However, a few studies applied the model to predict in-hospital mortality using routine blood samples at the time of hospital admission. This study aimed to develop an app, name predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients (PMCP) app, to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients at hospital-admission time. Methods: We downloaded patient records from 2 studies, including 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and 106 COVID-19 patients in 3 Korean medical institutions. A total of 30 feature variables were retrieved, consisting of 28 blood biomarkers and 2 demographic variables (i.e., age and gender) of patients. Two models, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), were compared with each other across 2 scenarios using1. raw laboratory versus normalized data and2. training vs testing datasets (n\u200a=\u200a361 and n\u200a=\u200a106/361\u224530%) to verify the model performance (e.g., sensitivity [SENS], specificity [SPEC], and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). An app for predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients was developed using the model's estimated parameters for the prediction and classification of PMCP at an earlier stage. Feature variables and prediction results were visualized using the forest plot and category probability curves shown on Google Maps. Results: We observed that1. the normalized dataset gains a relatively higher AUC(>0.9) when compared to that(<0.9) in the raw-laboratory dataset based on training data,2. the normalized dataset in ANN yielded a high AUC of 0.96 that that(=0.91) in CNN based on testing data, and3. a ready and available app, where anyone can access the model to predict mortality, for PMCP was developed in this study. Conclusions: Our new PMCP app with ANN model accurately predicts the mortality probability for COVID-19 patients. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patients\u2019 classifications against treatment risk.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026532", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8284724, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With the advent of deep learning approaches to CAD, there is great excitement about its application to medicine, yet there is little evidence demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy in clinically-relevant applications. We trained a deep learning model to detect fractures on radiographs with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons. We demonstrate that when emergency medicine clinicians are provided with the assistance of the trained model, their ability to accurately detect fractures significantly improves. Suspected fractures are among the most common reasons for patients to visit emergency departments (EDs), and X-ray imaging is the primary diagnostic tool used by clinicians to assess patients for fractures. Missing a fracture in a radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed treatment and poor recovery of function. Nevertheless, radiographs in emergency settings are often read out of necessity by emergency medicine clinicians who lack subspecialized expertise in orthopedics, and misdiagnosed fractures account for upward of four of every five reported diagnostic errors in certain EDs. In this work, we developed a deep neural network to detect and localize fractures in radiographs. We trained it to accurately emulate the expertise of 18 senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons by having them annotate 135,409 radiographs. We then ran a controlled experiment with emergency medicine clinicians to evaluate their ability to detect fractures in wrist radiographs with and without the assistance of the deep learning model. The average clinician\u2019s sensitivity was 80.8% (95% CI, 76.7\u201384.1%) unaided and 91.5% (95% CI, 89.3\u201392.9%) aided, and specificity was 87.5% (95 CI, 85.3\u201389.5%) unaided and 93.9% (95% CI, 92.9\u201394.9%) aided. The average clinician experienced a relative reduction in misinterpretation rate of 47.0% (95% CI, 37.4\u201353.9%). The significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy that we observed in this study show that deep learning methods are a mechanism by which senior medical specialists can deliver their expertise to generalists on the front lines of medicine, thereby providing substantial improvements to patient care.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/45/11591.full.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6233134, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this study, we show that the content shared by consenting users on Facebook can predict a future occurrence of depression in their medical records. Language predictive of depression includes references to typical symptoms, including sadness, loneliness, hostility, rumination, and increased self-reference. This study suggests that an analysis of social media data could be used to screen consenting individuals for depression. Further, social media content may point clinicians to specific symptoms of depression. Depression, the most prevalent mental illness, is underdiagnosed and undertreated, highlighting the need to extend the scope of current screening methods. Here, we use language from Facebook posts of consenting individuals to predict depression recorded in electronic medical records. We accessed the history of Facebook statuses posted by 683 patients visiting a large urban academic emergency department, 114 of whom had a diagnosis of depression in their medical records. Using only the language preceding their first documentation of a diagnosis of depression, we could identify depressed patients with fair accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.69], approximately matching the accuracy of screening surveys benchmarked against medical records. Restricting Facebook data to only the 6 months immediately preceding the first documented diagnosis of depression yielded a higher prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.72) for those users who had sufficient Facebook data. Significant prediction of future depression status was possible as far as 3 months before its first documentation. We found that language predictors of depression include emotional (sadness), interpersonal (loneliness, hostility), and cognitive (preoccupation with the self, rumination) processes. Unobtrusive depression assessment through social media of consenting individuals may become feasible as a scalable complement to existing screening and monitoring procedures.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/44/11203.full.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6217418, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection. Methods: Using 14\u2009035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Results: Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15% to 17% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5%, n=419, and 9.0%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively.

Along with advances in computer image analysis, this raises the possibility for computer-assisted diagnostics in pathology to improve histopathologic interpretation and clinical care. To evaluate the potential impact of digital assistance on interpretation of digitized slides, we conducted a multireader multicase study utilizing our deep learning algorithm for the detection of breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes. Six pathologists reviewed 70 digitized slides from lymph node sections in 2 reader modes, unassisted and assisted, with a wash-out period between sessions. In the assisted mode, the deep learning algorithm was used to identify and outline regions with high likelihood of containing tumor. Algorithm-assisted pathologists demonstrated higher accuracy than either the algorithm or the pathologist alone. In particular, algorithm assistance significantly increased the sensitivity of detection for micrometastases (91% vs. 83%, P=0.02). In addition, average review time per image was significantly shorter with assistance than without assistance for both micrometastases (61 vs. 116\u2009s, P=0.002) and negative images (111 vs. 137\u2009s, P=0.018). Lastly, pathologists were asked to provide a numeric score regarding the difficulty of each image classification. On the basis of this score, pathologists considered the image review of micrometastases to be significantly easier when interpreted with assistance (P=0.0005).

LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.\n\n\nRESULTS.\u2014\nLYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 \"normal\" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\u2014\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858/arpa.2018-0147-OA", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5858/arpa.2018-0147-OA?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2018-0147-OA, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For chest radiographs, DL algorithms have found success in the evaluation of abnormalities such as lung nodules, pulmonary tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, and location of peripherally inserted central catheters. Chest radiography represents the most commonly performed radiological test for a multitude of non-emergent and emergent clinical indications. This study aims to assess accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithm for detection of abnormalities on routine frontal chest radiographs (CXR), and assessment of stability or change in findings over serial radiographs. Methods and findings We processed 874 de-identified frontal CXR from 724 adult patients (> 18 years) with DL (Qure AI). Scores and prediction statistics from DL were generated and recorded for the presence of pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, hilar prominence, and enlarged cardiac silhouette. To establish a standard of reference (SOR), two thoracic radiologists assessed all CXR for these abnormalities. Four other radiologists (test radiologists), unaware of SOR and DL findings, independently assessed the presence of radiographic abnormalities. A total 724 radiographs were assessed for detection of findings. A subset of 150 radiographs with follow up examinations was used to asses change over time. Data were analyzed with receiver operating characteristics analyses and post-hoc power analysis. Results About 42% (305/ 724) CXR had no findings according to SOR; single and multiple abnormalities were seen in 23% (168/724) and 35% (251/724) of CXR. There was no statistical difference between DL and SOR for all abnormalities (p = 0.2\u20130.8). The area under the curve (AUC) for DL and test radiologists ranged between 0.837\u20130.929 and 0.693\u20130.923, respectively. DL had lowest AUC (0.758) for assessing changes in pulmonary opacities over follow up CXR. Presence of chest wall implanted devices negatively affected the accuracy of DL algorithm for evaluation of pulmonary and hilar abnormalities. Conclusions DL algorithm can aid in interpretation of CXR findings and their stability over follow up CXR. However, in its present version, it is unlikely to replace radiologists due to its limited specificity for categorizing specific findings.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204155&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6171827, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Findings In a diagnostic study evaluating 193 patients (386 images), the AI system judged 17 as having diabetic retinopathy of sufficient severity to require referral. While the system correctly identified the 2 patients with true disease (severe diabetic retinopathy), the positive predictive value was only 12%, with 15 patients misclassified as needing referral. Meaning Grading of diabetic retinopathy using AI has both potential benefits and challenges, and further study in real-world settings is needed.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2703944/kanagasingam_2018_oi_180132.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6324474, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006376&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6157905, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In a comparative cross-sectional reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by the CNN versus an international group of 58 dermatologists during level-I or -II of the reader study. Secondary end points included the dermatologists' diagnostic performance in their management decisions and differences in the diagnostic performance of dermatologists during level-I and -II of the reader study. Additionally, the CNN's performance was compared with the top-five algorithms of the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge.\n\n\nResults\nIn level-I dermatologists achieved a mean (\u00b1standard deviation) sensitivity and specificity for lesion classification of 86.6% (\u00b19.3%) and 71.3% (\u00b111.2%), respectively. More clinical information (level-II) improved the sensitivity to 88.9% (\u00b19.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.19) and specificity to 75.7% (\u00b111.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The CNN ROC curve revealed a higher specificity of 82.5% when compared with dermatologists in level-I (71.3%, P\u2009<\u20090.01) and level-II (75.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.01) at their sensitivities of 86.6% and 88.9%, respectively. The CNN ROC AUC was greater than the mean ROC area of dermatologists (0.86 versus 0.79, P\u2009<\u20090.01). The CNN scored results close to the top three algorithms of the ISBI 2016 challenge.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor the first time we compared a CNN's diagnostic performance with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN. Irrespective of any physicians' experience, they may benefit from assistance by a CNN's image classification.\n\n\nClinical trial number\nThis study was registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS-Study-ID: DRKS00013570; https://www.drks.de/drks_web/).", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923753419341055/pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/annonc/mdy166?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdy166, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We identified repeat OECD guideline tests to establish reproducibility of acute oral and dermal toxicity, eye and skin irritation, mutagenicity and skin sensitization. Based on 350\u2013700+ chemicals each, the probability that an OECD guideline animal test would output the same result in a repeat test was 78%\u201396% (sensitivity 50%\u201387%). An expanded database with more than 866 000 chemical properties/hazards was used as training data and to model health hazards and chemical properties. The constructed models automate and extend the read-across method of chemical classification. The novel models called RASARs (read-across structure activity relationship) use binary fingerprints and Jaccard distance to define chemical similarity. A large chemical similarity adjacency matrix is constructed from this similarity metric and is used to derive feature vectors for supervised learning. We show results on 9 health hazards from 2 kinds of RASARs\u2014\u201cSimple\u201d and \u201cData Fusion\u201d. The \u201cSimple\u201d RASAR seeks to duplicate the traditional read-across method, predicting hazard from chemical analogs with known hazard data. The \u201cData Fusion\u201d RASAR extends this concept by creating large feature vectors from all available property data rather than only the modeled hazard. Simple RASAR models tested in cross-validation achieve 70%\u201380% balanced accuracies with constraints on tested compounds. Cross validation of data fusion RASARs show balanced accuracies in the 80%\u201395% range across 9 health hazards with no constraints on tested compounds.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-pdf/165/1/198/26346766/kfy152.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6135638, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Another 84 million are prediabetic, and without intervention, up to 70% of these individuals may progress to type 2 diabetes. Current methods for quantifying blood glucose dysregulation in diabetes and prediabetes are limited by reliance on single-time-point measurements or on average measures of overall glycemia and neglect glucose dynamics. We have used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to evaluate the frequency with which individuals demonstrate elevations in postprandial glucose, the types of patterns, and how patterns vary between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance and secretion highlights the fact that the physiology underlying dysglycemia is highly variable between individuals. We developed an analytical framework that can group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses called \u201cglucotypes\u201d that reveal heterogeneity, or subphenotypes, within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. Importantly, we found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. We thus show that glucose dysregulation, as characterized by CGM, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures, and specific patterns of glycemic responses reflect variable underlying physiology. The interindividual variability in glycemic responses to standardized meals also highlights the personal nature of glucose regulation. Through extensive phenotyping, we developed a model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and built a webtool for visualizing a user-uploaded CGM profile and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005143&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6057684, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Meeting this demand, we developed Clairvoyante, a multi-task five-layer convolutional neural network model for predicting variant type (SNP or indel), zygosity, alternative allele and indel length from aligned reads. For the well-characterized NA12878 human sample, Clairvoyante achieved 99.73%, 97.68% and 95.36% precision on known variants, and 98.65%, 92.57%, 87.26% F1-score for whole-genome analysis, using Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data, respectively. Training on a second human sample shows Clairvoyante is sample agnostic and finds variants in less than two hours on a standard server. Furthermore, we identified 3,135 variants that are missed using Illumina but supported independently by both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore reads.

We develop a novel risk prediction algorithm and test its performance on the database of all patients who were registered for cardiac transplantation in the United States during 1985-2015. Methods and findings We develop a new, interpretable, methodology (ToPs: Trees of Predictors) built on the principle that specific predictive (survival) models should be used for specific clusters within the patient population. ToPs discovers these specific clusters and the specific predictive model that performs best for each cluster. In comparison with existing clinical risk scoring methods and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, our method provides significant improvements in survival predictions, both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. For instance: in terms of 3-month survival post-transplantation, our method achieves AUC of 0.660; the best clinical risk scoring method (RSS) achieves 0.587. In terms of 3-year survival/mortality predictions post-transplantation (in comparison to RSS), holding specificity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 2,442 (14.0%) more patients (of 17,441 who actually survived); holding sensitivity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 694 (13.0%) more patients (of 5,339 who did not survive). ToPs achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions pre-transplantation. ToPs discovers the most relevant features (covariates), uses available features to best advantage, and can adapt to changes in clinical practice. Conclusions We show that, in comparison with existing clinical risk-scoring methods and other machine learning methods, ToPs significantly improves survival predictions both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. ToPs provides a more accurate, personalized approach to survival prediction that can benefit patients, clinicians, and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy. Because survival prediction is widely used in clinical decision-making across diseases and clinical specialties, the implications of our methods are far-reaching.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194985&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5874060, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Thaiss et al. found that mice with systemic infection of a Salmonella analog, Citrobacter rodentium, also exhibited hyperglycemia. Deletion of the glucose transporter GLUT2 altered sensitivity to chemically induced epithelial permeability and protected mice from pathogen invasion. The authors also found a correlation in humans between glycated hemoglobin (an indicator of hyperglycemia) and serum levels of pathogen recognition receptor ligands. Science, this issue p. 1376 High blood sugar levels cause epithelial reprogramming, compromising gut barrier integrity and increasing susceptibility to pathogens. Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and systemic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated barrier disruption leads to systemic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial\u2013specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores barrier function and bacterial containment. In humans, systemic influx of intestinal microbiome products correlates with individualized glycemic control, indicated by glycated hemoglobin levels. Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal barrier function with systemic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/359/6382/1376.full.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1126/science.aar3318?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar3318, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite the proliferation of these \"AI principles,\" there has been little scholarly focus on understanding these efforts either individually or as contextualized within an expanding universe of principles with discernible trends.\r\n\r\nTo that end, this white paper and its associated data visualization compare the contents of thirty-six prominent AI principles documents side-by-side. This effort uncovered a growing consensus around eight key thematic trends: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. Underlying this \u201cnormative core,\u201d our analysis examined the forty-seven individual principles that make up the themes, detailing notable similarities and differences in interpretation found across the documents. In sharing these observations, it is our hope that policymakers, advocates, scholars, and others working to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of AI will be better positioned to build on existing efforts and to push the fractured, global conversation on the future of AI toward consensus.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/42160420/1/HLS%20White%20Paper%20Final_v3.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.3518482?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3518482, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

On the one hand, a part of the community defends that black-box models are more accurate than explainable models in some contexts, like image preprocessing. On the other hand, there exist another part of the community alleging that explainable models are better than black-box models because they can obtain comparable results and also they can explain these results in a language close to a human expert by using patterns. In this paper, advantages and weaknesses for each approach are shown; taking into account a state-of-the-art review for both approaches, their practical applications, trends, and future challenges. This paper shows that both approaches are suitable for solving practical problems, but experts in machine learning need to understand the input data, the problem to solve, and the best way for showing the output data before applying a machine learning model. Also, we propose some ideas for fusing both, explainable and black-box, approaches to provide better solutions to experts in real-world domains. Additionally, we show one way to measure the effectiveness of the applied machine learning model by using expert opinions jointly with statistical methods. Throughout this paper, we show the impact of using explainable and black-box models on the security and medical applications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08882211.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949286?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949286, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Whilst learning linguistic knowledge, these models may also be storing relational knowledge present in the training data, and may be able to answer queries structured as \u201cfill-in-the-blank\u201d cloze statements. Language models have many advantages over structured knowledge bases: they require no schema engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and require no human supervision to train. We present an in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of state-of-the-art pretrained language models. We find that (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably well on open-domain question answering against a supervised baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are learned much more readily than others by standard language model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as unsupervised open-domain QA systems.

Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide \u201cobviously\u201d interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/5962385/9591206/09233366.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07374, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2018.2870052", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Deep learning models in various forms have been the standard for solving VQA. However, some of these VQA models are better at certain types of image-question pairs than other models. Ensembling VQA models intelligently to leverage their diverse expertise is, therefore, advantageous. Stacking With Auxiliary Features (SWAF) is an intelligent ensembling technique which learns to combine the results of multiple models using features of the current problem as context. We propose four categories of auxiliary features for ensembling for VQA. Three out of the four categories of features can be inferred from an image-question pair and do not require querying the component models. The fourth category of auxiliary features uses model-specific explanations. In this paper, we describe how we use these various categories of auxiliary features to improve performance for VQA. Using SWAF to effectively ensemble three recent systems, we obtain a new state-of-the-art. Our work also highlights the advantages of explainable AI models.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1201.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://aclanthology.org/N18-1201, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Algorithms for predicting recidivism are commonly used to assess a criminal defendant\u2019s likelihood of committing a crime. These predictions are used in pretrial, parole, and sentencing decisions. Proponents of these systems argue that big data and advanced machine learning make these analyses more accurate and less biased than humans. We show, however, that the widely used commercial risk assessment software COMPAS is no more accurate or fair than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise. In addition, despite COMPAS\u2019s collection of 137 features, the same accuracy can be achieved with a simple linear classifier with only two features.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/4/1/eaao5580.full.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5777393, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Achieving these in human-robot collaborative contexts can be especially challenging, as humans and robots are unlikely to share a common language to convey intentions, plans, or justifications. Even in cases where human co-workers can inspect a robot's control code, and particularly when statistical methods are used to encode control policies, there is no guarantee that meaningful insights into a robot's behavior can be derived or that a human will be able to efficiently isolate the behaviors relevant to the interaction. We present a series of algorithms and an accompanying system that enables robots to autonomously synthesize policy descriptions and respond to both general and targeted queries by human collaborators. We demonstrate applicability to a variety of robot controller types including those that utilize conditional logic, tabular reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning, synthesizing informative policy descriptions for collaborators and facilitating fault diagnosis by non-experts.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/116013/1/hri17.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCSA", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/2909824.3020233?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/2909824.3020233, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Two experiments explore the relationship between how a property is explained and how that property is generalized to novel species and artifacts. The experiments contrast the consequences of explaining a property mechanistically, by appeal to parts and processes, with the consequences of explaining the property functionally, by appeal to functions and goals. The findings suggest that properties that are explained functionally are more likely to be generalized on the basis of shared functions, with a weaker relationship between mechanistic explanations and generalization on the basis of shared parts and processes. The influence of explanation type on generalization holds even though all participants are provided with the same mechanistic and functional information, and whether an explanation type is freely generated (Experiment 1), experimentally provided (Experiment 2), or experimentally induced (Experiment 2). The experiments also demonstrate that explanations and generalizations of a particular type (mechanistic or functional) can be experimentally induced by providing sample explanations of that type, with a comparable effect when the sample explanations come from the same domain or from a different domains. These results suggest that explanations serve as a guide to generalization, and contribute to a growing body of work supporting the value of distinguishing mechanistic and functional explanations.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00700/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4160962, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We then define a notion of degree of blame, which takes into account an agent's epistemic state.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.", "year": 2018, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2018.2870052", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, most algorithms that learn comprehensible classifiers use classification model size as a metric that guides the search in the space of all possible classifiers instead of comprehensibility - which is ill-defined. Several surveys have shown that such simple complexity metrics do not correspond well to the comprehensibility of classification trees. This paper therefore suggests a classification tree comprehensibility survey in order to derive an exhaustive comprehensibility metrics better reflecting the human sense of classifier comprehensibility and obtain new insights about comprehensibility of classification trees", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.6025/isej/2019/6/1/15-20", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.6025/ISEJ/2019/6/1/15-20?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.6025/ISEJ/2019/6/1/15-20, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Given any CNN model, the proposed method draws on a data set of concepts to score the semantics of hidden units at each intermediate convolutional layer. The units with semantics are labeled across a broad range of visual concepts including objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed method to test the hypothesis that interpretability is an axis-independent property of the representation space, then we apply the method to compare the latent representations of various networks when trained to solve different classification problems. We further analyze the effect of training iterations, compare networks trained with different initializations, and measure the effect of dropout and batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shed light on characteristics of CNN models and training methods that go beyond measurements of their discriminative power.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/124985/2/final-network-dissection.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCSA", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The proposed methodology allows for the construction of a prediction band for the response variable using any estimator of the regression function. The resulting prediction band preserves the consistency properties of the original estimator under standard assumptions, while guaranteeing finite-sample marginal coverage even when these assumptions do not hold. We analyze and compare, both empirically and theoretically, the two major variants of our conformal framework: full conformal inference and split conformal inference, along with a related jackknife method. These methods offer different tradeoffs between statistical accuracy (length of resulting prediction intervals) and computational efficiency. As extensions, we develop a method for constructing valid in-sample prediction intervals called rank-one-out conformal inference, which has essentially the same computational efficiency as split conformal inference. We also describe an extension of our procedures for producing prediction bands with locally varying length, to adapt to heteroscedasticity in the data. Finally, we propose a model-free notion of variable importance, called leave-one-covariate-out or LOCO inference. Accompanying this article is an R package conformalInference that implements all of the proposals we have introduced. In the spirit of reproducibility, all of our empirical results can also be easily (re)generated using this package.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Distribution-Free_Predictive_Inference_For_Regression/4812304/2/files/7968109.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04173, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest. We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4498753, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. \nIn its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. \nInitially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. \nJohn H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan.

A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1500", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1500?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1500, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments. While other CNN models may offer similar accuracy levels, our approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization, rendering it practical for real-world applications in agriculture. Furthermore, our CNN model exhibits resilience to environmental variations and imaging parameters, enhancing its applicability across diverse agricultural settings. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the approach developed in this experimental work contributes to modernizing fruits and vegetables sorting operations in food processing, crop management practices thus promoting agricultural sustainability. The scalability and portability of our model make it suitable for deployment in both small-scale farms and large-scale agricultural operations.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul195", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul195?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul195, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study explores the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, for predicting daily climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Utilizing historical climate data from the city of Delhi, we developed an LSTM model to forecast short-term climate trends. The model consists of two LSTM layers followed by three Dense layers and is compiled with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error loss, and mean absolute error as a metric. Our results demonstrate the model's capability to capture temporal dependencies in climate data, achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy in temperature forecasting. This research underscores the potential of machine learning techniques, particularly LSTM networks, in enhancing climate prediction and contributing to more informed decision-making in weather-sensitive sectors.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul073", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul073?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul073, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The manufacturing industry has an important role in industrial development. It is hoped that it will be able to grow and have advantages in industrial development, therefore it is necessary to improve and increase product quality. The company continues to strive to maintain and improve product quality and increase productivity so that customers are satisfied with the products produced. One way that needs to be done is to reduce the number of defective products in the production process. This effort is one way of continuous improvement carried out by PT. ABC and companies operating in the same field. The ceramic wall production process has relatively high demand but still has a high level of defects. Based on information on production data and data on the number of defects for the period January \u2013 September 2023, wall ceramic production has a defect rate of 3.86%. Companies must reduce the number of defects to achieve company targets. This research aims to improve the production process of wall ceramics by minimizing the number of defective products. This research uses the six sigma method with the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) tool assisted by the FMEA (Failure Mode and Analysis) method. Corrective action to reduce defects based on the 5 Why analysis is to find out what the problem is and ask \"why\" and \"what is the root of the problem\". The research results show that there are 4 types of defects which have a large number of defects, namely Rupture Defects, Application Defects, Peeling Defects and Hole Defects. From the research results, solutions were obtained for the emergence of several types of defects in the wall ceramic production process, namely by providing planning suggestions and corrective actions which are discussed this time. At the defect calculation stage, Broken produces a DPMO value of 29.362 with a sigma level of 3.39 with a sigma level of 3.48, Defect Peeled produces a DPMO value of 28.044 with a sigma level of 3.38, and holes are defective. resulting in a DPMO value of 26,020 with a sigma value of 3.45 from the data calculation results, it is still not enough to meet the company's target at the sigma level, therefore the company must make quality improvements to achieve the main target at the sigma level.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jun1035", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jun1035?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jun1035, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Velocity profiles show how fluids and particles flow through the hydrocyclone in complex ways, while pressure distributions show where high and low pressure is found, regions that are critical for maximizing separation efficiency. Furthermore, the analysis of viscosity fluctuations clarifies the intricate relationship between fluid rheology and flow dynamics, providing information on how food's viscoelastic characteristics affect particle trajectories and separation efficiency. Utilizing this comprehensive examination, scientists hope to optimize the design and functioning parameters of the hydrocyclones, which will in turn improve the efficacy and efficiency of particle separation procedures in viscoelastic food solutions. This will ultimately lead to improvements in food processing technology and product quality. Researchers look into the impact of geometric elements on flow patterns and separation efficiency in addition to these characteristics, such as hydrocyclone size and inlet configurations. Additionally, they investigate how different operating parameters, such rotational speed and flow rate, affect how well the hydrocyclone handles viscoelastic food items.

Omnichannel organizations situate the customer at the core of their interaction. However, research on omnichannel customer experience (CX) is still fragmented. In this paper, by adopting an integrative approach, we aim to articulate the empirical evidence around omnichannel CX and its management. Moreover, we show how research around omnichannel CX emerged from different theoretical perspectives and disciplines such as marketing, sociology and computer science. Towards this goal, we conducted a systematic literature review\u2014with in depth analysis of 50 papers\u2014and identified that omnichannel CX literature has engaged a number of research streams from various theoretical perspectives. Based on the research gaps, we propose an agenda for future research including topics such as (1) understanding the customer lifecycle in an omnichannel context; (2) integrating new touchpoints and channels; (3) predicting the omnichannel customer behavior; and (4) approaching omnichannel CX in service-based organizations. We conclude that adopting an omnichannel CX management approach requires the entire organization to be customer-centric while articulating interdisciplinary teams. Available studies on omnichannel CX provide the foundations for extending the knowledge on this topic and developing tools for practitioners to use in the omnichannel management assessment, operationalization, and measurement.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/5/2824/pdf?version=1615120495", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/SU13052824?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13052824, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research paper delves into the essence of XAI, unraveling its significance across diverse domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. As a countermeasure to the opacity of intricate models, the paper explores various XAI methods and techniques, including LIME and SHAP, weighing their interpretability against computational efficiency and accuracy. Through an examination of real-world applications, the research elucidates how XAI not only enhances decision-making processes but also influences user trust and acceptance in AI systems. However, the paper also scrutinizes the delicate balance between interpretability and performance, shedding light on instances where the pursuit of accuracy may compromise explain-ability.

The essays in this book explore the tacit dimension of architecture in its aesthetic, material, cultural, design-based, and reflexive understanding of what we build. Tacit knowledge, described in 1966 by Michael Polanyi as what we \u2018can know but cannot tell\u2019, often denotes knowledge that escapes quantifiable dimensions of research. Much of architecture\u2019s knowledge resides beneath the surface, in nonverbal instruments such as drawings and models that articulate the spatial imagination of the design process. Awareness of the tacit dimension helps to understand the many facets of the spaces we inhabit, from the ideas of the architect to the more hidden assumptions of our cultures. Beginning in the studio, where students are guided into becoming architects, the book follows a path through the tacit knowledge present in materials, conceptual structures, and the design process, revealing how the tacit dimension leads to craftsmanship and the situated knowledge of architecture-in-the-world.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/258/oa_edited_volume/book/83868/pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2307/j.ctv1mgm7ng?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1mgm7ng, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We achieve interpretability by modeling the interactions between high-level actions as an automaton with connections to formal logic. We achieve manipulability by integrating this automaton into planning, so that changes to the automaton have predictable effects on the learned behavior. These qualities allow a human user to first understand what the model has learned, and then either correct the learned behavior or zero-shot generalize to new, similar tasks. We build upon previous work by no longer requiring additional supervised information which is hard to collect in practice. We achieve this by using a deep Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical model.

The unwinding of the urban non-college occupational skill gradient has, I argue, abetted a secular fall in real non-college wages by: (1) shunting non-college workers out of specialized middle-skill occupations into low-wage occupations that require only generic skills; (2) diminishing the set of non-college workers that hold middle-skill jobs in high-wage cities; and (3) attenuating, to a startling degree, the steep urban wage premium for non-college workers that prevailed in earlier decades.

This time-consuming task typically requires expert radiologists to read the images, leading to fatigue-based diagnostic error and lack of diagnostic expertise in areas of the world where radiologists are not available. Recently, deep learning approaches have been able to achieve expert-level performance in medical image interpretation tasks, powered by large network architectures and fueled by the emergence of large labeled datasets. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a deep learning algorithm on the detection of pathologies in chest radiographs compared with practicing radiologists. Methods and findings We developed CheXNeXt, a convolutional neural network to concurrently detect the presence of 14 different pathologies, including pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonary masses, and nodules in frontal-view chest radiographs. CheXNeXt was trained and internally validated on the ChestX-ray8 dataset, with a held-out validation set consisting of 420 images, sampled to contain at least 50 cases of each of the original pathology labels. On this validation set, the majority vote of a panel of 3 board-certified cardiothoracic specialist radiologists served as reference standard. We compared CheXNeXt\u2019s discriminative performance on the validation set to the performance of 9 radiologists using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The radiologists included 6 board-certified radiologists (average experience 12 years, range 4\u201328 years) and 3 senior radiology residents, from 3 academic institutions. We found that CheXNeXt achieved radiologist-level performance on 11 pathologies and did not achieve radiologist-level performance on 3 pathologies. The radiologists achieved statistically significantly higher AUC performance on cardiomegaly, emphysema, and hiatal hernia, with AUCs of 0.888 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863\u20130.910), 0.911 (95% CI 0.866\u20130.947), and 0.985 (95% CI 0.974\u20130.991), respectively, whereas CheXNeXt\u2019s AUCs were 0.831 (95% CI 0.790\u20130.870), 0.704 (95% CI 0.567\u20130.833), and 0.851 (95% CI 0.785\u20130.909), respectively. CheXNeXt performed better than radiologists in detecting atelectasis, with an AUC of 0.862 (95% CI 0.825\u20130.895), statistically significantly higher than radiologists' AUC of 0.808 (95% CI 0.777\u20130.838); there were no statistically significant differences in AUCs for the other 10 pathologies. The average time to interpret the 420 images in the validation set was substantially longer for the radiologists (240 minutes) than for CheXNeXt (1.5 minutes). The main limitations of our study are that neither CheXNeXt nor the radiologists were permitted to use patient history or review prior examinations and that evaluation was limited to a dataset from a single institution. Conclusions In this study, we developed and validated a deep learning algorithm that classified clinically important abnormalities in chest radiographs at a performance level comparable to practicing radiologists. Once tested prospectively in clinical settings, the algorithm could have the potential to expand patient access to chest radiograph diagnostics.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002686&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6245676, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While many people nonetheless use GDP as a proxy for well-being, consumer surplus is a better measure of consumer well-being. This is increasingly true in the digital economy where many digital goods have zero price and as a result the welfare gains from these goods are not reflected in GDP or productivity statistics. We propose a way of directly measuring consumer well-being using massive online choice experiments. We find that digital goods generate a large amount of consumer welfare that is currently not captured in GDP. For example, the median Facebook user needed a compensation of around $48 to give it up for a month. Gross domestic product (GDP) and derived metrics such as productivity have been central to our understanding of economic progress and well-being. In principle, changes in consumer surplus provide a superior, and more direct, measure of changes in well-being, especially for digital goods. In practice, these alternatives have been difficult to quantify. We explore the potential of massive online choice experiments to measure consumer surplus. We illustrate this technique via several empirical examples which quantify the valuations of popular digital goods and categories. Our examples include incentive-compatible discrete-choice experiments where online and laboratory participants receive monetary compensation if and only if they forgo goods for predefined periods. For example, the median user needed a compensation of about $48 to forgo Facebook for 1 mo. Our overall analyses reveal that digital goods have created large gains in well-being that are not reflected in conventional measures of GDP and productivity. By periodically querying a large, representative sample of goods and services, including those which are not priced in existing markets, changes in consumer surplus and other new measures of well-being derived from these online choice experiments have the potential for providing cost-effective supplements to the existing national income and product accounts.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/15/7250.full.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6462102, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is therefore desirable to reduce social media users\u2019 exposure to low-quality news content. One possible intervention is for social media ranking algorithms to show relatively less content from sources that users deem to be untrustworthy. But are laypeople\u2019s judgments reliable indicators of quality, or are they corrupted by either partisan bias or lack of information? Perhaps surprisingly, we find that laypeople\u2014on average\u2014are quite good at distinguishing between lower- and higher-quality sources. These results indicate that incorporating the trust ratings of laypeople into social media ranking algorithms may prove an effective intervention against misinformation, fake news, and news content with heavy political bias. Reducing the spread of misinformation, especially on social media, is a major challenge. We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (\u201cfake news\u201d). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans\u2014mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans\u2014every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/7/2521.full.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6377495, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Theory of Mind Predicts Collective Intelligence Equally Well Online and Face-To-Face", "abstract": "Recent research with face-to-face groups found that a measure of general group effectiveness (called \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d) predicted a group\u2019s performance on a wide range of different tasks. The same research also found that collective intelligence was correlated with the individual group members\u2019 ability to reason about the mental states of others (an ability called \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d or \u201cToM\u201d). Since ToM was measured in this work by a test that requires participants to \u201cread\u201d the mental states of others from looking at their eyes (the \u201cReading the Mind in the Eyes\u201d test), it is uncertain whether the same results would emerge in online groups where these visual cues are not available. Here we find that: (1) a collective intelligence factor characterizes group performance approximately as well for online groups as for face-to-face groups; and (2) surprisingly, the ToM measure is equally predictive of collective intelligence in both face-to-face and online groups, even though the online groups communicate only via text and never see each other at all. This provides strong evidence that ToM abilities are just as important to group performance in online environments with limited nonverbal cues as they are face-to-face. It also suggests that the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test measures a deeper, domain-independent aspect of social reasoning, not merely the ability to recognize facial expressions of mental states.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115212&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4267836, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Objective The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior change. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated the feasibility or efficacy of AI chatbots for behavior change. The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles were performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6, 40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1, 7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and expert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of the moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI techniques, and limitation for generalizability.

This study retrospectively evaluates how a commercially available deep learning algorithm can detect pneumonia in chest radiographs (CR) in emergency departments. The chest radiographs of 948 patients with dyspnea between 3 February and 8 May 2020, as well as 15 October and 15 December 2020, were used. A deep learning algorithm was used to identify opacifications associated with pneumonia, and the performance was evaluated by using ROC analysis, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV. Two radiologists assessed all enrolled images for pulmonal infection patterns as the reference standard. If consolidations or opacifications were present, the radiologists classified the pulmonal findings regarding a possible COVID-19 infection because of the ongoing pandemic. The AUROC value of the deep learning algorithm reached 0.923 when detecting pneumonia in chest radiographs with a sensitivity of 95.4%, specificity of 66.0%, PPV of 80.2% and NPV of 90.8%. The detection of COVID-19 pneumonia in CR by radiologists was achieved with a sensitivity of 50.6% and a specificity of 73%. The deep learning algorithm proved to be an excellent tool for detecting pneumonia in chest radiographs.

Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss. Objective This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched. Results A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality\u2013based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances. Conclusions AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/4/e32578/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9047740, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There are two ways for computers to identify drug interactions: one is to identify known drug interactions, and the other is to predict unknown drug interactions.

Objective We sought to identify current frameworks guiding the application and evaluation of AI for predictive analytics in medicine and to describe the content of these frameworks. We also assessed what stages along the AI translational spectrum (ie, AI development, reporting, evaluation, implementation, and surveillance) the content of each framework has been discussed. Methods We performed a literature review of frameworks regarding the oversight of AI in medicine. The search included key topics such as \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cguidance as topic,\u201d and \u201ctranslational science,\u201d and spanned the time period 2014-2022. Documents were included if they provided generalizable guidance regarding the use or evaluation of AI in medicine. Included frameworks are summarized descriptively and were subjected to content analysis. A novel evaluation matrix was developed and applied to appraise the frameworks\u2019 coverage of content areas across translational stages. Results Fourteen frameworks are featured in the review, including six frameworks that provide descriptive guidance and eight that provide reporting checklists for medical applications of AI. Content analysis revealed five considerations related to the oversight of AI in medicine across frameworks: transparency, reproducibility, ethics, effectiveness, and engagement. All frameworks include discussions regarding transparency, reproducibility, ethics, and effectiveness, while only half of the frameworks discuss engagement. The evaluation matrix revealed that frameworks were most likely to report AI considerations for the translational stage of development and were least likely to report considerations for the translational stage of surveillance. Conclusions Existing frameworks for the application and evaluation of AI in medicine notably offer less input on the role of engagement in oversight and regarding the translational stage of surveillance. Identifying and optimizing strategies for engagement are essential to ensure that AI can meaningfully benefit patients and other end users.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e36823/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9459836, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Design characteristics that influence the look and feel of the virtual assistant, such as visual appearance or language features, may significantly influence users\u2019 experience and engagement with the assistant. Objective This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, summarize research findings of experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, and provide recommendations for the design of virtual health assistants if sufficient evidence exists. Methods We searched 5 electronic databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) to identify the studies that used an experimental design to compare the effects of design characteristics between 2 or more versions of an interactive virtual health assistant on user experience among adults. Data were synthesized descriptively. Health domains, design characteristics, and outcomes were categorized, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the body of research. Results for each study were categorized as positive, negative, or no effect, and a matrix of the design characteristics and outcome categories was constructed to summarize the findings. Results The database searches identified 6879 articles after the removal of duplicates. We included 48 articles representing 45 unique studies in the review. The most common health domains were mental health and physical activity. Studies most commonly examined design characteristics in the categories of visual design or conversational style and relational behavior and assessed outcomes in the categories of personality, satisfaction, relationship, or use intention. Over half of the design characteristics were examined by only 1 study. Results suggest that empathy and relational behavior and self-disclosure are related to more positive user experience. Results also suggest that if a human-like avatar is used, realistic rendering and medical attire may potentially be related to more positive user experience; however, more research is needed to confirm this. Conclusions There is a growing body of scientific evidence examining the impact of virtual health assistants\u2019 design characteristics on user experience. Taken together, data suggest that the look and feel of a virtual health assistant does affect user experience. Virtual health assistants that show empathy, display nonverbal relational behaviors, and disclose personal information about themselves achieve better user experience. At present, the evidence base is broad, and the studies are typically small in scale and highly heterogeneous. Further research, particularly using longitudinal research designs with repeated user interactions, is needed to inform the optimal design of virtual health assistants.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2021/12/e31737/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8734926, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

However, the association patterns, that is, the mechanism of response (MoR) between large-scale multiomics features and drug response are complex and heterogeneous and remain unclear. Although there are existing computational models for predicting drug response using the high-dimensional multiomics features, it remains challenging to uncover the complex molecular mechanism of drug responses. To reduce the number of predictors/features and make the model more interpretable, in this study, 46 signaling pathways were used to build a deep learning model constrained by signaling pathways, consDeepSignaling, for anti\u2013drug response prediction. Multiomics data, like gene expression and copy number variation, of individual genes can be integrated naturally in this model. The signaling pathway\u2013constrained deep learning model was evaluated using the multiomics data of \u223c1000 cancer cell lines in the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database and the corresponding drug\u2013cancer cell line response data set in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database.

Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence\u2013driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. Objective This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Methods American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. Results The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants\u2019 W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change \u22129.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change \u22121.3, SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change \u22121.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change \u22122.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). Conclusions W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with substantial morbidity, especially when it goes undetected. If new-onset AF could be predicted, targeted screening could be used to find it early. We hypothesized that a deep neural network could predict new-onset AF from the resting 12-lead ECG and that this prediction may help identify those at risk of AF-related stroke. Methods: We used 1.6 M resting 12-lead digital ECG traces from 430\u2009000 patients collected from 1984 to 2019. Deep neural networks were trained to predict new-onset AF (within 1 year) in patients without a history of AF. Performance was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve. We performed an incidence-free survival analysis for a period of 30 years following the ECG stratified by model predictions. To simulate real-world deployment, we trained a separate model using all ECGs before 2010 and evaluated model performance on a test set of ECGs from 2010 through 2014 that were linked to our stroke registry. We identified the patients at risk for AF-related stroke among those predicted to be high risk for AF by the model at different prediction thresholds. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve were 0.85 and 0.22, respectively, for predicting new-onset AF within 1 year of an ECG. The hazard ratio for the predicted high- versus low-risk groups over a 30-year span was 7.2 (95% CI, 6.9\u20137.6). In a simulated deployment scenario, the model predicted new-onset AF at 1 year with a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 81%. The number needed to screen to find 1 new case of AF was 9. This model predicted patients at high risk for new-onset AF in 62% of all patients who experienced an AF-related stroke within 3 years of the index ECG. Conclusions: Deep learning can predict new-onset AF from the 12-lead ECG in patients with no previous history of AF. This prediction may help identify patients at risk for AF-related strokes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047829", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7996054, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This latent, precise information contributes to stratify TC on the distinct risk and drives tailored management to transit from the surface (population-based) to a point (individual-based).

People with ASD have characteristic social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. The causes of this disorder remain unknown; however, in up to 25% of cases, a genetic cause can be identified. Detecting ASD as early as possible is desirable because early detection of ASD enables timely interventions in children with ASD. Identification of ASD based on objective pathogenic mutation screening is the major first step toward early intervention and effective treatment of affected children. Objective Recent investigation interrogated genomics data for detecting and treating autism disorders, in addition to the conventional clinical interview as a diagnostic test. Since deep neural networks perform better than shallow machine learning models on complex and high-dimensional data, in this study, we sought to apply deep learning to genetic data obtained across thousands of simplex families at risk for ASD to identify contributory mutations and to create an advanced diagnostic classifier for autism screening. Methods After preprocessing the genomics data from the Simons Simplex Collection, we extracted top ranking common variants that may be protective or pathogenic for autism based on a chi-square test. A convolutional neural network\u2013based diagnostic classifier was then designed using the identified significant common variants to predict autism. The performance was then compared with shallow machine learning\u2013based classifiers and randomly selected common variants. Results The selected contributory common variants were significantly enriched in chromosome X while chromosome Y was also discriminatory in determining the identification of autistic individuals from nonautistic individuals. The ARSD, MAGEB16, and MXRA5 genes had the largest effect in the contributory variants. Thus, screening algorithms were adapted to include these common variants. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.955 and an accuracy of 88% for identifying autistic individuals from nonautistic individuals. Our classifier demonstrated a considerable improvement of ~13% in terms of classification accuracy compared to standard autism screening tools. Conclusions Common variants are informative for autism identification. Our findings also suggest that the deep learning process is a reliable method for distinguishing the diseased group from the control group based on the common variants of autism.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://medinform.jmir.org/2021/4/e24754/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8060867, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. Methods We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot\u2019s relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e22845/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7557439, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human\u2013AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.thelancet.com/article/S2589750020302193/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8212701, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics as well as training and decoding criteria.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.173.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00661, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Healthcare is the prime candidate needing the transformative capability of this smartness. Social media could enable a ubiquitous and continuous engagement between healthcare stakeholders, leading to better public health. Current works are limited in their scope, functionality, and scalability. This paper proposes Sehaa, a big data analytics tool for healthcare in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) using Twitter data in Arabic. Sehaa uses Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and multiple feature extraction methods to detect various diseases in the KSA. Sehaa found that the top five diseases in Saudi Arabia in terms of the actual afflicted cases are dermal diseases, heart diseases, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes. Riyadh and Jeddah need to do more in creating awareness about the top diseases. Taif is the healthiest city in the KSA in terms of the detected diseases and awareness activities. Sehaa is developed over Apache Spark allowing true scalability. The dataset used comprises 18.9 million tweets collected from November 2018 to September 2019. The results are evaluated using well-known numerical criteria (Accuracy and F1-Score) and are validated against externally available statistics.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/4/1398/pdf?version=1582803929", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/app10041398?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/app10041398, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our classifier has a low-demanding feature processing that only requires a single ECG lead. Its training and validation follows an inter-patient procedure. Our approach is compatible with an online classification that aligns well with recent advances in health-monitoring wireless devices and wearables. The use of a combination of ensembles allows us to exploit parallelism to train the classifier with remarkable speeds. The heartbeat classifier is evaluated over two ECG databases, the MIT-BIH AR and the AHA. In the MIT-BIH AR database, our classification approach provides a sensitivity of 92.7% and positive predictive value of 86.1% for the ventricular ectopic beats, using the single lead II, and a sensitivity of 95.7% and positive predictive value of 75.1% when using the lead V1'.

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) works in this context; it was passed in April 2016 and came into force in May 2018 across the European Union. This study is the first attempt to test the effectiveness of this legal reform for personal health data protection. Using the difference-in-difference (DID) approach, this study empirically examines the policy influence of the GDPR on the financial performance of hospitals across the European Union. Results show that hospitals with the digital health service suffered from financial distress after the GDPR was published in 2016. This reveals that during the transition period (2016\u20132018), hospitals across the European Union indeed made costly adjustments to meet the requirements of personal health data protection introduced by this new regulation, and thus inevitably suffered a policy shock to their financial performance in the short term. The implementation of GDPR may have achieved preliminary success.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/6/1070/pdf?version=1553766789", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6466053, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In a comparative cross-sectional reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by the CNN versus an international group of 58 dermatologists during level-I or -II of the reader study. Secondary end points included the dermatologists' diagnostic performance in their management decisions and differences in the diagnostic performance of dermatologists during level-I and -II of the reader study. Additionally, the CNN's performance was compared with the top-five algorithms of the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge.\n\n\nResults\nIn level-I dermatologists achieved a mean (\u00b1standard deviation) sensitivity and specificity for lesion classification of 86.6% (\u00b19.3%) and 71.3% (\u00b111.2%), respectively. More clinical information (level-II) improved the sensitivity to 88.9% (\u00b19.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.19) and specificity to 75.7% (\u00b111.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The CNN ROC curve revealed a higher specificity of 82.5% when compared with dermatologists in level-I (71.3%, P\u2009<\u20090.01) and level-II (75.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.01) at their sensitivities of 86.6% and 88.9%, respectively. The CNN ROC AUC was greater than the mean ROC area of dermatologists (0.86 versus 0.79, P\u2009<\u20090.01). The CNN scored results close to the top three algorithms of the ISBI 2016 challenge.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor the first time we compared a CNN's diagnostic performance with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN. Irrespective of any physicians' experience, they may benefit from assistance by a CNN's image classification.\n\n\nClinical trial number\nThis study was registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS-Study-ID: DRKS00013570; https://www.drks.de/drks_web/).", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923753419341055/pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/annonc/mdy166?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdy166, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

They show potential for improving access to therapy and improving population mental health. However, their use in the real world, ie, as implemented (disseminated) outside of research settings, may differ from that reported in trials, and implementation data are seldom reported. Objective This study aimed to review peer-reviewed articles reporting user uptake and/or ongoing use, retention, or completion data (hereafter usage data or, for brevity, engagement) from implemented pure self-help (unguided) digital interventions for depression, anxiety, or the enhancement of mood. Methods We conducted a systematic search of the Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases for studies reporting user uptake and/or usage data from implemented digital self-help interventions for the treatment or prevention of depression or anxiety, or the enhancement of mood, from 2002 to 2017. Additionally, we screened the reference lists of included articles, citations of these articles, and the titles of articles published in Internet Interventions, Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), and JMIR Mental Health since their inception. We extracted data indicating the number of registrations or downloads and usage of interventions. Results After the removal of duplicates, 970 papers were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. Hand searching identified 1 additional article. The included articles reported on 7 publicly available interventions. There was little consistency in the measures reported. The number of registrants or downloads ranged widely, from 8 to over 40,000 per month. From 21% to 88% of users engaged in at least minimal use (eg, used the intervention at least once or completed one module or assessment), whereas 7-42% engaged in moderate use (completing between 40% and 60% of modular fixed-length programs or continuing to use apps after 4 weeks). Indications of completion or sustained use (completion of all modules or the last assessment or continuing to use apps after six weeks or more) varied from 0.5% to 28.6%. Conclusions Available data suggest that uptake and engagement vary widely among the handful of implemented digital self-help apps and programs that have reported this, and that usage may vary from that reported in trials. Implementation data should be routinely gathered and reported to facilitate improved uptake and engagement, arguably among the major challenges in digital health.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9275", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6010835, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, \u201cDepression in College Students,\u201d as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants\u2019 comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://mental.jmir.org/2017/2/e19/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5478797, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Here we show that by fine tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding, and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of new designs. In a manner analogous to networks which produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse, complex, functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/12/14/2022.12.09.519842.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1101/2022.12.09.519842?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.09.519842, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pre-training on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and fine-tuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole-genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing this on large biological data.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/11/23/2022.10.10.511571.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9709791, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While many techniques exist to generate explanations, it remains unclear how to select and visually present AI explanations based on the characteristics of domain users. This paper aims to understand this question through a multidisciplinary design study for a specific problem: explaining graph neural network (GNN) predictions to domain experts in drug repurposing, i.e., reuse of existing drugs for new diseases. Building on the nested design model of visualization, we incorporate XAI design considerations from a literature review and from our collaborators' feedback into the design process. Specifically, we discuss XAI-related design considerations for usable visual explanations at each design layer: target user, usage context, domain explanation, and XAI goal at the domain layer; format, granularity, and operation of explanations at the abstraction layer; encodings and interactions at the visualization layer; and XAI and rendering algorithm at the algorithm layer. We present how the extended nested model motivates and informs the design of DrugExplorer, an XAI tool for drug repurposing. Based on our domain characterization, DrugExplorer provides path-based explanations and presents them both as individual paths and meta-paths for two key XAI operations, why and what else. DrugExplorer offers a novel visualization design called MetaMatrix with a set of interactions to help domain users organize and compare explanation paths at different levels of granularity to generate domain-meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected visual presentation and DrugExplorer as a whole via a usage scenario, a user study, and expert interviews. From these evaluations, we derive insightful observations and reflections that can inform the design of XAI visualizations for other scientific applications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/2945/9991003/09916585.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209435?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209435, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Because of the complex mechanisms underlying protein formation, the creation of a novel protein requires tedious and time-consuming computational or experimental protocols. At the same time, machine learning has enabled the solving of complex problems by leveraging large amounts of available data, more recently with great improvements on the domain of generative modeling. Yet, generative models have mainly been applied to specific sub-problems of protein design. Results Here we approach the problem of general purpose protein design conditioned on functional labels of the hierarchical Gene Ontology. Since a canonical way to evaluate generative models in this domain is missing, we devise an evaluation scheme of several biologically and statistically inspired metrics. We then develop the conditional generative adversarial network ProteoGAN and show that it outperforms several classic and more recent deep learning baselines for protein sequence generation. We further give insights into the model by analysing hyperparameters and ablation baselines. Lastly, we hypothesize that a functionally conditional model could generate proteins with novel functions by combining labels and provide first steps into this direction of research.

Here we propose a new model, QA-GNN, which addresses the above challenges through two key innovations: (i) relevance scoring, where we use LMs to estimate the importance of KG nodes relative to the given QA context, and (ii) joint reasoning, where we connect the QA context and KG to form a joint graph, and mutually update their representations through graph-based message passing. We evaluate QA-GNN on the CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA datasets, and show its improvement over existing LM and LM+KG models, as well as its capability to perform interpretable and structured reasoning, e.g., correctly handling negation in questions.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.45.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06378, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The database contains over 60 million sequences, of which over half a million sequences have been curated by experts who critically review experimental and predicted data for each protein. The remainder are automatically annotated based on rule systems that rely on the expert curated knowledge. Since our last update in 2014, we have more than doubled the number of reference proteomes to 5631, giving a greater coverage of taxonomic diversity. We implemented a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this pipeline reduced the number of sequences in UniProt by 47 million. For our users interested in the accessory proteomes, we have made available sets of pan proteome sequences that cover the diversity of sequences for each species that is found in its strains and sub-strains. To help interpretation of genomic variants, we provide tracks of detailed protein information for the major genome browsers.

Here, we use deep network hallucination to generate a wide range of symmetric protein homo-oligomers given only a specification of the number of protomers and the protomer length. Crystal structures of seven designs are very similar to the computational models (median root mean square deviation: 0.6 angstroms), as are three cryo\u2013electron microscopy structures of giant 10-nanometer rings with up to 1550 residues and C33 symmetry; all differ considerably from previously solved structures. Our results highlight the rich diversity of new protein structures that can be generated using deep learning and pave the way for the design of increasingly complex components for nanomachines and biomaterials. Description Deep learning takes on protein design Deep learning approaches such as Alphafold and Rosettafold have made reliable protein structure prediction broadly accessible. For the inverse problem, finding a sequence that folds to a desired structure, most approaches remain based on energy optimization. In two papers, a range of protein design problems were addressed through deep learning methods. Dauparas et al. built on recent deep learning protein design approaches to develop a method called ProteinMPNN. They validated designs experimentally and showed that ProteinMPNN can rescue previously failed designs made using Rosetta or Alphafold. Wicky et al. started from a random sequence and used Monte Carlo sequence search coupled with structure prediction by Alphafold to design cyclic homo-oligomers. Although the designs were generated to achieve stable expression, the sequences had to be regenerated using ProteinMPNN. This approach allowed for the design of a range of experimentally validated cyclic oligomers and paves the way for the design of increasingly complex assemblies. \u2014VV A network-based protein design enables the generation of cyclic homo-oligomers across the nanoscopic scale.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9724707", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9724707, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Machine learning approaches to this problem to date have been limited by the number of available experimentally determined protein structures. We augment training data by nearly three orders of magnitude by predicting structures for 12M protein sequences using AlphaFold2. Trained with this additional data, a sequence-to-sequence transformer with invariant geometric input processing layers achieves 51% native sequence recovery on structurally held-out backbones with 72% recovery for buried residues, an overall improvement of almost 10 percentage points over existing methods.

We also present overlapping challenges across the multiple scientific domains where common solutions can be found.

In this Review, we studied the growth and distribution of AI-related chemistry publications in the last two decades using the CAS Content Collection. The volume of both journal and patent publications have increased dramatically, especially since 2015. Study of the distribution of publications over various chemistry research areas revealed that analytical chemistry and biochemistry are integrating AI to the greatest extent and with the highest growth rates. We also investigated trends in interdisciplinary research and identified frequently occurring combinations of research areas in publications. Furthermore, topic analyses were conducted for journal and patent publications to illustrate emerging associations of AI with certain chemistry research topics. Notable publications in various chemistry disciplines were then evaluated and presented to highlight emerging use cases. Finally, the occurrence of different classes of substances and their roles in AI-related chemistry research were quantified, further detailing the popularity of AI adoption in the life sciences and analytical chemistry. In summary, this Review offers a broad overview of how AI has progressed in various fields of chemistry and aims to provide an understanding of its future directions.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00619", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00619?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00619, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind's Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek et al. explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. Science, abj8754, this issue p. 871 Protein structure modeling enables the rapid solution of protein structures and provides insights into function. DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo\u2013electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7612213", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7612213, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, there is, now, cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In this article, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, that is, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/5/9420072/09363924.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3058954?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2021.3058954, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In contrast, machine-learning models can approximate physics very quickly but at the cost of accuracy. Here we show that using machine learning inside traditional fluid simulations can improve both accuracy and speed, even on examples very different from the training data. Our approach opens the door to applying machine learning to large-scale physical modeling tasks like airplane design and climate prediction. Numerical simulation of fluids plays an essential role in modeling many physical phenomena, such as weather, climate, aerodynamics, and plasma physics. Fluids are well described by the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable trade-offs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10\u00d7 finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101784118", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01010, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Non-equilibrium materials synthesis is emblematic of complex, resource-intensive experimentation whose acceleration would be a watershed for materials discovery and development. The mapping of non-equilibrium synthesis phase diagrams has recently been accelerated via high throughput experimentation but still limits materials research because the parameter space is too vast to be exhaustively explored. We demonstrate accelerated synthesis and exploration of metastable materials through hierarchical autonomous experimentation governed by the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent (SARA). SARA integrates robotic materials synthesis and characterization along with a hierarchy of AI methods that efficiently reveal the structure of processing phase diagrams. SARA designs lateral gradient laser spike annealing (lg-LSA) experiments for parallel materials synthesis and employs optical spectroscopy to rapidly identify phase transitions. Efficient exploration of the multi-dimensional parameter space is achieved with nested active learning (AL) cycles built upon advanced machine learning models that incorporate the underlying physics of the experiments as well as end-to-end uncertainty quantification. With this, and the coordination of AL at multiple scales, SARA embodies AI harnessing of complex scientific tasks. We demonstrate its performance by autonomously mapping synthesis phase boundaries for the Bi$_2$O$_3$ system, leading to orders-of-magnitude acceleration in establishment of a synthesis phase diagram that includes conditions for kinetically stabilizing $\\delta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ at room temperature, a critical development for electrochemical technologies such as solid oxide fuel cells.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abg4930?download=true", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07385, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As virtual libraries continue to grow (in excess of 108 molecules), so too do the resources necessary to conduct exhaustive virtual screening campaigns on these libraries. However, Bayesian optimization techniques, previously employed in other scientific discovery problems, can aid in their exploration: a surrogate structure\u2013property relationship model trained on the predicted affinities of a subset of the library can be applied to the remaining library members, allowing the least promising compounds to be excluded from evaluation. In this study, we explore the application of these techniques to computational docking datasets and assess the impact of surrogate model architecture, acquisition function, and acquisition batch size on optimization performance. We observe significant reductions in computational costs; for example, using a directed-message passing neural network we can identify 94.8% or 89.3% of the top-50\u2009000 ligands in a 100M member library after testing only 2.4% of candidate ligands using an upper confidence bound or greedy acquisition strategy, respectively. Such model-guided searches mitigate the increasing computational costs of screening increasingly large virtual libraries and can accelerate high-throughput virtual screening campaigns with applications beyond docking.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/sc/d0sc06805e", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07127, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

If that hypothesis was correct, we could more easily both understand our own intelligence and build intelligent machines. Just like in physics, the principles themselves would not be sufficient to predict the behaviour of complex systems like brains, and substantial computation might be needed to simulate human-like intelligence. This hypothesis would suggest that studying the kind of inductive biases that humans and animals exploit could help both clarify these principles and provide inspiration for AI research and neuroscience theories. Deep learning already exploits several key inductive biases, and this work considers a larger list, focusing on those which concern mostly higher-level and sequential conscious processing. The objective of clarifying these particular principles is that they could potentially help us build AI systems benefiting from humans\u2019 abilities in terms of flexible out-of-distribution and systematic generalization, which is currently an area where a large gap exists between state-of-the-art machine learning and human intelligence.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2021.0068", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15091, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The review utilised the PRISMA framework to review the analysis and synthesis process encompassing the search, screening, coding, and data analysis strategy of 141 items included in the corpus. Key findings extracted from the review incorporate a taxonomy of artificial intelligence applications with associated teaching and learning practice and a framework for helping teachers to develop and self-reflect on the skills and capabilities envisioned for employing artificial intelligence in education. Implications for ethical use and a set of propositions for enacting teaching and learning using artificial intelligence are demarcated. The findings of this review contribute to developing a better understanding of how artificial intelligence may enhance teachers\u2019 roles as catalysts in designing, visualising, and orchestrating AI-enabled teaching and learning, and this will, in turn, help to proliferate AI-systems that render computational representations based on meaningful data-driven inferences of the pedagogy, domain, and learner models.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/13/1/14/pdf?version=1640911167", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/info13010014?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/info13010014, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Popularised in the UK, this paper aims to extend and evaluate the applicability of science capital in the context of China by drawing on PISA2015. More specifically, we make use of existing items in the PISA2015 survey as a proxy for operationalising the construct of science capital to explore the science career aspirations and attainments of 15-year-old Chinese and UK students (n\u2009=\u200923,998). Our findings indicate that science capital has more explanatory power for understanding UK students\u2019 science career aspirations than for Chinese students, where science attainment seems most important. We raise the potential challenge for Chinese students to convert their science capital into scientific self-efficacy and science career aspirations as we highlight the importance of recognising cultural and national differences in operationalising science capital.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09500693.2019.1662135?needAccess=true", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/09500693.2019.1662135?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2019.1662135, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In addition, online vocational education or higher education has also captured the psychology of national learning, and online tutoring has gradually entered into nonstudent groups such as office workers. Although online education has the advantages of low cost and no limitation of time and space, it also has some problems, such as low classroom satisfaction, delayed feedback from students, and poor teaching effect. Therefore, this paper aims at this problem by combining the development background of foreign intelligent answer system and self-test system, and introducing it into our computer application, using artificial intelligence for natural language processing, aiming at online teaching students cannot get timely answer, and self-test questions intelligent system design.

In order to understand the quality of education and teaching system in colleges and universities, to improve the school conditions, and to promote the reform of teaching management, methods and means of evaluating the quality of education and teaching system in general higher education institutions are needed. Modern university education and teaching system should realize the combination of classroom teaching and practice teaching, and education and teaching system adopts the mode of the combination of on-campus practice and off-campus practice, so the design of teaching system is the key to the quality of teaching. Aiming at the current problem that talents cultivated by colleges and universities can hardly meet social demands in terms of engineering practice ability, innovation ability, and international competitiveness, this paper proposes the evaluation and adjustment of college education and teaching system driven by algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI). By designing the teaching system of talent cultivation, and then establishing a quantitative and controllable quality assurance system for practical teaching, a new mechanism for the design of university education system is further explored. Specifically, the framework of the instructional system is built with the aid of an actor-critic algorithm in reinforcement learning, which assists in the design of the university education system, allowing students to truly understand, master and flex their knowledge, and strengthening the correct understanding of the students' internal learning mechanisms. The practical teaching effect shows that the AI-driven instructional designs are more popular with contemporary students and have higher evaluation scores. The numerical experiment results also show the stability of the instructional design, overcoming the drawbacks of traditional manual subjectivity in the design. AI-driven college education and teaching system is conducive to cultivating students' solid technical theoretical foundation. Therefore, through the AI-driven teaching system to strengthen the training of practical ability, so as to comprehensively improve students' comprehensive quality and innovation ability.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2022/8503239.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9482482, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The participants of the study were open education faculty students in a higher education institution in Turkey. In this quasi-experimental quantitative study repeated measures design was adopted. the participants were given writing tasks each week in a nine-week writing activity and they received feedback from their English language teachers for the first three tasks, and they received feedback from the software for the last three tasks. All participants wrote an English text as a diagnostic test at the beginning of the process. At the end of the teacher and software feedback phases, they took post-tests. All grades were statistically analyzed in order to find any effect of regular feedback either from a language teacher or from an online software on academic writing achievement. Results revealed significant differences between the diagnostic test and two achievement tests. Participants tended to improve their academic writing skills by taking regular feedback, and it was observed that the writing scores increased slightly more when receiving feedback from teachers compared to automated feedback software.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/2343966", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17718/tojde.1096260?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17718/tojde.1096260, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The advancement of computer technologies, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI), provides an opportunity to cope with this problem by diagnosing individual students\u2019 learning problems and providing personalized supports to maximize their learning performances in mathematics courses. However, there is a lack of reviews from diverse perspectives to help researchers, especially novices, gain a whole picture of the research of AI in mathematics education. To this end, this research aims to conduct a bibliometric mapping analysis and systematic review to explore the role and research trends of AI in mathematics education by searching for the relevant articles published in the quality journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from the Web of Science (WOS) database. Moreover, by referring to the technology-based learning model, several dimensions of AI in mathematics education research, such as the application domains, participants, research methods, adopted technologies, research issues and the roles of AI as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account. Accordingly, the advancements of AI in mathematics education research are reported, and potential research topics for future research are recommended.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/6/584/pdf?version=1615429441", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/MATH9060584?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/MATH9060584, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Within education, AI is a rapidly emerging field and there is a strong potential for AI to greatly extend and enhance teaching and learning in higher education (Crompton et al., 2020). AI is defined as \u201ccomputing systems that are able to engage in human-like processes such as learning, adapting, synthesizing, self-correction and use of data for complex processing tasks\u201d (Popenici & Kerr, 2017). In the Horizon Report 2020 report (Brown et al., 2020), AI is listed as one of six technologies with the potential for high impact in higher education. The Horizon Report (2020), is an annual publication that examines the major trends in educational technology that are shaping global higher education. This paper will highlight some of the ways AI is supporting both students and faculty members including bespoke learning, intelligent tutoring systems, facilitating collaboration, and automated grading.

A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors\u2019 duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students\u2019 assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students\u2019 needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09069875.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This technology is already being introduced in the field of higher education, although many teachers are unaware of its scope and, above all, of what it consists of. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to analyse the scientific production on artificial intelligence in higher education indexed in Web of Science and Scopus databases during 2007\u20132017. A bespoke methodology of bibliometric studies was used in the most relevant databases in social science. The sample was composed of 132 papers in total. From the results obtained, it was observed that there is a worldwide interest in the topic and that the literature on this subject is just at an incipient stage. We conclude that, although artificial intelligence is a reality, the scientific production about its application in higher education has not been consolidated.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/9/1/51/pdf?version=1552040644", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/EDUCSCI9010051?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/EDUCSCI9010051, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment. Description Editor\u2019s summary Automation has historically displaced human workers in factories (e.g., automotive manufacturing) or in performing routine computational tasks. Will generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT disrupt the labor market by making educated professionals obsolete, or will these tools complement their skills and enhance productivity?

Other workers that are not directly affected by automation may however fear that these new technologies might replace their working tasks in the future. This fear of a possible future replacement is important because it negatively affects workers\u2019 job satisfaction at present. This paper studies the extent to which automation affects workers\u2019 job satisfaction, and whether this effect differs for high- versus low-skilled workers. The empirical analysis uses microdata for several thousand workers in Norway from the Working Life Barometer survey for the period 2016\u20132019, combined with information on the introduction of industrial robots in Norway from the International Federation of Robotics. Our identification strategy exploits variation in the pace of introduction of industrial robots in Norwegian regions and industries since 2007 to instrument workers\u2019 fear of replacement. The results indicate that automation in industrial firms in recent years have induced 40% of the workers that are currently in employment to fear that their work might be replaced by a smart machine in the future. Such fear of future replacement does negatively affect workers\u2019 job satisfaction at present. This negative effect is driven by low-skilled workers, which are those carrying out routine-based tasks, and who are therefore more exposed to the risks of automation.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242929&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7703879, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human\u2013machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/14/6531.full.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6452673, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3386/w23285", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1086/705716?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1086/705716, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

ChatGPT is a type of chatbot, developed by OpenAI, that uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model to understand and respond to natural language inputs. AI chatbot and ChatGPT in particular appear to be useful tools in scientific writing, assisting researchers and scientists in organizing material, generating an initial draft and/or in proofreading. There is no publication in the field of critical care medicine prepared using this approach; however, this will be a possibility in the next future. ChatGPT work should not be used as a replacement for human judgment and the output should always be reviewed by experts before being used in any critical decision-making or application. Moreover, several ethical issues arise about using these tools, such as the risk of plagiarism and inaccuracies, as well as a potential imbalance in its accessibility between high- and low-income countries, if the software becomes paying. For this reason, a consensus on how to regulate the use of chatbots in scientific writing will soon be required.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13054-023-04380-2", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960412, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Methods We gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated. Results All ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journal\u2019s formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing. Conclusion ChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00819-6.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1101/2022.12.23.521610?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.23.521610, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

When these two technologies are combined, the ethical, legal and societal issues increase substantially, become much more complex, and can be scaled enormously, which increases the impact. Adding to these complexities, both genomics and AI-enabled technologies are rife with scientific and technological uncertainties, which makes the regulation of these technologies not only challenging in itself, but also creates legal uncertainties. In science, the precautionary principle has been used globally to govern uncertainty, with the specific aim to prevent irreversible harm to human beings. The regulation of uncertainties in AI-enabled technologies is based on risk as set out in the AI Regulation that was recently proposed by the European Commission. However, when genomics and artificial intelligence are combined, not only do uncertainties double, but the current regulation of such uncertainties towards the safe use thereof for humans seems contradictory, considering the different approaches followed by science and technology in this regard. In this article, I explore the regulation of both scientific and technological uncertainties and argue that the application of the precautionary principle in the context of human genomics and AI seems to be the most effective way to regulate the uncertainties brought about by the combination of these two technologies.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://sajs.co.za/article/download/15037/19947", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11426231, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The potential applications of LLMs in health care education, research, and practice could be promising if the associated valid concerns are proactively examined and addressed. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders in health care education, research, and practice is urgently needed.

According to the statistics of the International Diabetes Federation, about 537 million people worldwide (10.5% of the global population) suffer from diabetes, and it is estimated that 643 million people will develop the condition (11.3% of the total population) by 2030. If this trend continues, the number will jump to 783 million (12.2%) by 2045. At present, the number of people with diabetes in Taiwan has reached 2.18 million, with an average of one in ten people suffering from the disease. In addition, according to the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan, the prevalence rate of diabetes among adults in Taiwan has reached 5% and is increasing each year. Diabetes can cause acute and chronic complications that can be fatal. Meanwhile, chronic complications can result in a variety of disabilities or organ decline. If holistic treatments and preventions are not provided to diabetic patients, it will lead to the consumption of more medical resources and a rapid decline in the quality of life of society as a whole. In this study, based on the outpatient examination data of a Taipei Municipal medical center, 15,000 women aged between 20 and 80 were selected as the subjects. These women were patients who had gone to the medical center during 2018\u20132020 and 2021\u20132022 with or without the diagnosis of diabetes. This study investigated eight different characteristics of the subjects, including the number of pregnancies, plasma glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, sebum thickness, insulin level, body mass index, diabetes pedigree function, and age. After sorting out the complete data of the patients, this study used Microsoft Machine Learning Studio to train the models of various kinds of neural networks, and the prediction results were used to compare the predictive ability of the various parameters for diabetes. Finally, this study found that after comparing the models using two-class logistic regression as well as the two-class neural network, two-class decision jungle, or two-class boosted decision tree for prediction, the best model was the two-class boosted decision tree, as its area under the curve could reach a score of 0.991, which was better than other models.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/13/3/406/pdf?version=1677489027", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10057336, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To combat the lack of understanding of AI-based systems, Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make black-box AI models more transparent and comprehensible for humans. Fortunately, plenty of XAI methods have been introduced to tackle the explainability problem from different perspectives. However, due to the vast search space, it is challenging for ML practitioners and data scientists to start with the development of XAI software and to optimally select the most suitable XAI methods. To tackle this challenge, we introduce XAIR, a novel systematic metareview of the most promising XAI methods and tools. XAIR differentiates itself from existing reviews by aligning its results to the five steps of the software development process, including requirement analysis, design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment. Through this mapping, we aim to create a better understanding of the individual steps of developing XAI software and to foster the creation of real-world AI applications that incorporate explainability.

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is one of the common healthcare applications that assist doctors to monitor patients with chronic or acute illness at remote locations, elderly people in\u2010home care, and even hospitalized patients. The reliability of manual patient monitoring systems depends on staff time management which is dependent on their workload. Conventional patient monitoring involves invasive approaches which require skin contact to monitor health status. This study aims to do a comprehensive review of RPM systems including adopted advanced technologies, AI impact on RPM, challenges and trends in AI\u2010enabled RPM. This review explores the benefits and challenges of patient\u2010centric RPM architectures enabled with Internet of Things wearable devices and sensors using the cloud, fog, edge, and blockchain technologies. The role of AI in RPM ranges from physical activity classification to chronic disease monitoring and vital signs monitoring in emergency settings. This review results show that AI\u2010enabled RPM architectures have transformed healthcare monitoring applications because of their ability to detect early deterioration in patients' health, personalize individual patient health parameter monitoring using federated learning, and learn human behavior patterns using techniques such as reinforcement learning. This review discusses the challenges and trends to adopt AI to RPM systems and implementation issues.

We classified the studies according to the stage of an event, including pre-event training to guide performance and predict the possibility of injuries; during events to optimise performance and inform strategies; and in diagnosing injuries after an event. Based on the included studies, AI techniques to process data from sensors can detect patterns in physiological variables as well as positional and kinematic data to inform how athletes can improve their performance.

In this case study, we describe the development of such a governance structure at University of Wisconsin Health (UWH) that provides oversight of AI applications from assessment of validity and user acceptability through safe deployment with continuous monitoring for effectiveness. Our structure leverages a multi-disciplinary steering committee along with project specific sub-committees. Members of the committee formulate a multi-stakeholder perspective spanning informatics, data science, clinical operations, ethics, and equity. Our structure includes guiding principles that provide tangible parameters for endorsement of both initial deployment and ongoing usage of AI applications. The committee is tasked with ensuring principles of interpretability, accuracy, and fairness across all applications. To operationalize these principles, we provide a value stream to apply the principles of AI governance at different stages of clinical implementation. This structure has enabled effective clinical adoption of AI applications. Effective governance has provided several outcomes: (1) a clear and institutional structure for oversight and endorsement; (2) a path towards successful deployment that encompasses technologic, clinical, and operational, considerations; (3) a process for ongoing monitoring to ensure the solution remains acceptable as clinical practice and disease prevalence evolve; (4) incorporation of guidelines for the ethical and equitable use of AI applications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.931439", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9448877, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The study relied on two main parallel sources to identify barriers to use AI methodologies in HTA in CEE, including a scoping literature review and iterative focus group meetings with HTx team members. Most of the other selected articles discussed AI from a clinical perspective (n = 25), and the rest are from regulatory perspective (n = 13), and transfer of knowledge point of view (n = 3). Clinical areas studied are quite diverse\u2014from pediatric, diabetes, diagnostic radiology, gynecology, oncology, surgery, psychiatry, cardiology, infection diseases, and oncology. Out of all 38 articles, 25 (66%) describe the AI method and the rest are more focused on the utilization barriers of different health care services and programs. The potential barriers could be classified as data related, methodological, technological, regulatory and policy related, and human factor related. Some of the barriers are quite similar, especially concerning the technologies. Studies focusing on the AI usage for HTA decision making are scarce. AI and augmented decision making tools are a novel science, and we are in the process of adapting it to existing needs. HTA as a process requires multiple steps, multiple evaluations which rely on heterogenous data. Therefore, the observed range of barriers come as a no surprise, and experts in the field need to give their opinion on the most important barriers in order to develop recommendations to overcome them and to disseminate the practical application of these tools.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.921226/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9330148, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant problems to medical systems and healthcare facilities due to its unexpected global expansion. Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques, and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time. However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5\u201315 years to 1\u20132 years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human coronavirus by using different datasets. The AI tools and computational approaches have led to speedy research and the development of a vaccine to fight against the coronavirus. Therefore, this paper suggests the role of artificial intelligence in the field of clinical trials of vaccines and clinical practices using different tools.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/7205241.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9279074, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Within healthcare, much attention has been placed upon the ability of deductive AI systems to analyse large datasets to find patterns that would be unfeasible to program. Generative AI, including generative adversarial networks, are a newer type of machine learning that functions to create fake data after learning the properties of real data. Artificially generated patient data has the potential to revolutionise clinical research and protect patient privacy. Using novel techniques, it is increasingly possible to fully anonymise datasets to the point where no datapoint is traceable to any real individual. This can be used to expand and balance datasets as well as to replace the use of real patient data in certain contexts. This paper focuses upon three key uses of synthetic data: clinical research, data privacy and medical education.

As a result, the purpose of this review is to identify the potential machine learning applications in the field of infectious diseases and the general healthcare system. The literature on this topic was extracted from various databases, such as Google, Google Scholar, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The articles having important information were selected for this review. The most challenging task for AI in such healthcare sectors is to sustain its adoption in daily clinical practice, regardless of whether the programs are scalable enough to be useful. Based on the summarized data, it has been concluded that AI can assist healthcare staff in expanding their knowledge, allowing them to spend more time providing direct patient care and reducing weariness.

One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/4664312/10007429/09804787.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12705, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Remote COVID-19 monitoring platforms emerged as potential solutions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity and contribution of two different platforms used to remotely monitor patients with COVID-19 to maintain quality, safety, and patient engagement in care, as well as their acceptability, usefulness, and user-friendliness from the user's perspective. The first platform is focused on telecare phone calls (Telecare-Covid), and the second is a telemonitoring app (CareSimple-Covid). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study. The data were collected through a phone survey from May to August 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-test analysis. Participants' responses and comments on open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis to identify certain issues and challenges and potential avenues for improving the platforms. Results: Fifty one patients participated in the study. Eighteen participants used the CareSimple-Covid platform and 33 participants used the Telecare-Covid platform. Overall, the satisfaction rate for quality and safety of care for the two platforms was 80%. Over 88% of the users on each platform considered the platforms' services to be engaging, useful, user-friendly, and appropriate to their needs. The survey identified a few significant differences in users' perceptions of each platform: empathy toward users and the quality and safety of the care received were rated significantly higher on the CareSimple-Covid platform than on the Telecare-Covid platform. Users appreciated four aspects of these telehealth approaches: (1) the ease of access to services and the availability of care team members; (2) the user-friendliness of the platforms; (3) the continuity of care provided, and (4) the wide range of services delivered. Users identified some technical limitations and raised certain issues, such as the importance of maintaining human contact, data security, and confidentiality. Improvement suggestions include promoting access to connected devices; enhancing communications between institutions, healthcare users, and the public on confidentiality and personal data protection standards; and integrating a participatory approach to telehealth platform development and deployment efforts. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that the two remote monitoring platforms are well-received by users, with very few significant differences between them concerning users' experiences and views. This type of program could be considered for use in a post-pandemic era and for other post-hospitalization clienteles. To maximize efficiency, the areas for improvement and the issues identified should be addressed with a patient-centered approach.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.721044", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8630581, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Because of the sudden increase in cases, most countries have faced scarcity and a low rate of testing. Chest X-rays have been shown in the literature to be a potential source of testing for COVID-19 patients, but manually checking X-ray reports is time-consuming and error-prone. Considering these limitations and the advancements in data science, we proposed a Vision Transformer-based deep learning pipeline for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray-based imaging. Due to the lack of large data sets, we collected data from three open-source data sets of chest X-ray images and aggregated them to form a 30 K image data set, which is the largest publicly available collection of chest X-ray images in this domain to our knowledge. Our proposed transformer model effectively differentiates COVID-19 from normal chest X-rays with an accuracy of 98% along with an AUC score of 99% in the binary classification task. It distinguishes COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia patient\u2019s X-rays with an accuracy of 92% and AUC score of 98% in the Multi-class classification task. For evaluation on our data set, we fine-tuned some of the widely used models in literature, namely, EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNetV3, Xception, and DenseNet-121, as baselines. Our proposed transformer model outperformed them in terms of all metrics. In addition, a Grad-CAM based visualization is created which makes our approach interpretable by radiologists and can be used to monitor the progression of the disease in the affected lungs, assisting healthcare.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111086", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8583247, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Specifically, the process provides daily lists of high-risk patients to all public hospitals for customized discharge procedures within 24 h of admission. We analyzed all public hospital admissions (N = 150,322) in a year. Among four models, the gradient boosting machine performed the best (AUC = 0.79) with a positive predictive value set at 70%. Interestingly, the cumulative length of stay (LOS) in the past 12 months was a stronger predictor than the number of previous admissions, as it is a better proxy for acute care utilization. Another important predictor was the \u201cnumber of days from previous non-elective admission\u201d, which is different from previous studies that included both elective and non-elective admissions. Of note, the model did not include LOS of the index admission\u2014a key predictor in other models\u2014since our predictive model identified frequent admitters for pre-discharge interventions during the index (current) admission.

Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice. Objective This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies. Results In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation. Conclusions This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from the field of implementation science.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2022/1/e32215/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8832266, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage them and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases. Given the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes, deep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a key limitation of current study remains their capacity in processing long sequences, and long sequence modelling and its application in the context of healthcare and EHR remains unexplored. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to lead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for decades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field of the most existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing crucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a hierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the receptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer sequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal EHR, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art deep learning models 1% to 5% for area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 1% to 8% for area under the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 2% to 8% (AUROC) and 2% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction. Additionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not well-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training strategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting clinical events with relatively small training dataset.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6221020/10036335/09964038.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11360, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has challenged this model, as strict physical distancing rules and a shift in the allocation of hospital resources resulted in many neurological patients not receiving essential therapy. Accordingly, a recent survey revealed that the majority of European healthcare professionals involved in stroke care are concerned that this lack of care will have a noticeable negative impact on functional outcomes. COVID-19 highlights an urgent need to rethink conventional neurorehabilitation and develop alternative approaches to provide high-quality therapy while minimizing hospital stays and visits. Technology-based solutions, such as, robotics bear high potential to enable such a paradigm shift. While robot-assisted therapy is already established in clinics, the future challenge is to enable physically assisted therapy and assessments in a minimally supervized and decentralized manner, ideally at the patient\u2019s home. Key enablers are new rehabilitation devices that are portable, scalable and equipped with clinical intelligence, remote monitoring and coaching capabilities. In this perspective article, we discuss clinical and technological requirements for the development and deployment of minimally supervized, robot-assisted neurorehabilitation technologies in patient\u2019s homes. We elaborate on key principles to ensure feasibility and acceptance, and on how artificial intelligence can be leveraged for embedding clinical knowledge for safe use and personalized therapy adaptation.

Reuse permitted under CC BYNC. No commercial reuse. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. INTRODUCTION Machine learning for healthcare (MLHC) is at the juncture of leaping from the pages of journals and conference proceedings to clinical implementation at the bedside. Succeeding in this endeavour requires the synthesis of insights from both the machine learning and healthcare domains, in order to ensure that the unique characteristics of MLHC are leveraged to maximise benefits and minimise risks. An important part of this effort is establishing and formalising processes and procedures for characterising these tools and assessing their performance. Meaningful progress in this direction can be found in recently developed guidelines for the development of MLHC models, guidelines for the design and reporting of MLHC clinical trials, 3 and protocols for the regulatory assessment of MLHC tools. 5 But while such guidelines and protocols engage extensively with relevant technical considerations, engagement with issues of fairness, bias and unintended disparate impact is lacking. Such issues have taken on a place of prominence in the broader ML community, with recent work highlighting issues such as racial disparities in the accuracy of facial recognition and gender classification software, 10 gender bias in the output of natural language processing models 12 and racial bias in algorithms for bail and criminal sentencing. MLHC is not immune to these concerns, as seen in disparate outcomes from algorithms for allocating healthcare resources, 15 bias in language models developed on clinical notes and melanoma detection models developed primarily on images of lightcoloured skin. Within this paper, we will examine the inclusion of fairness in recent guidelines for MLHC model reporting, clinical trials and regulatory approval. We highlight opportunities to ensure that fairness is made fundamental to MLHC, and examine ways how this can be operationalised for the MLHC context.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://informatics.bmj.com/content/bmjhci/28/1/e100289.full.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8733939, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Combining such data with self-reported information about psychological symptoms may provide a more comprehensive and contextualized view of a patient\u2019s mental state than questionnaire data alone. However, mobile sensed data are usually noisy and incomplete, with significant amounts of missing observations. Therefore, recognizing the clinical potential of mHealth tools depends critically on developing methods to cope with such data issues. Objective This study aims to present a machine learning\u2013based approach for emotional state prediction that uses passively collected data from mobile phones and wearable devices and self-reported emotions. The proposed methods must cope with high-dimensional and heterogeneous time-series data with a large percentage of missing observations. Methods Passively sensed behavior and self-reported emotional state data from a cohort of 943 individuals (outpatients recruited from community clinics) were available for analysis. All patients had at least 30 days\u2019 worth of naturally occurring behavior observations, including information about physical activity, geolocation, sleep, and smartphone app use. These regularly sampled but frequently missing and heterogeneous time series were analyzed with the following probabilistic latent variable models for data averaging and feature extraction: mixture model (MM) and hidden Markov model (HMM). The extracted features were then combined with a classifier to predict emotional state. A variety of classical machine learning methods and recurrent neural networks were compared. Finally, a personalized Bayesian model was proposed to improve performance by considering the individual differences in the data and applying a different classifier bias term for each patient. Results Probabilistic generative models proved to be good preprocessing and feature extractor tools for data with large percentages of missing observations. Models that took into account the posterior probabilities of the MM and HMM latent states outperformed those that did not by more than 20%, suggesting that the underlying behavioral patterns identified were meaningful for individuals\u2019 overall emotional state. The best performing generalized models achieved a 0.81 area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and 0.71 area under the precision-recall curve when predicting self-reported emotional valence from behavior in held-out test data. Moreover, the proposed personalized models demonstrated that accounting for individual differences through a simple hierarchical model can substantially improve emotional state prediction performance without relying on previous days\u2019 data. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the feasibility of designing machine learning models for predicting emotional states from mobile sensing data capable of dealing with heterogeneous data with large numbers of missing observations. Such models may represent valuable tools for clinicians to monitor patients\u2019 mood states.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jmir.org/api/download?alt_name=mhealth_v9i3e24465_app1.pdf&filename=fa5ffed215ab737c1cdc678dcfbca721.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8088855, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been proven particularly applicable in health care, with the ability for complex dialog management and conversational flexibility. Objective This review article aims to report on the recent advances and current trends in chatbot technology in medicine. A brief historical overview, along with the developmental progress and design characteristics, is first introduced. The focus will be on cancer therapy, with in-depth discussions and examples of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, patient support, workflow efficiency, and health promotion. In addition, this paper will explore the limitations and areas of concern, highlighting ethical, moral, security, technical, and regulatory standards and evaluation issues to explain the hesitancy in implementation. Methods A search of the literature published in the past 20 years was conducted using the IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID databases. The screening of chatbots was guided by the open-access Botlist directory for health care components and further divided according to the following criteria: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, support, workflow, and health promotion. Results Even after addressing these issues and establishing the safety or efficacy of chatbots, human elements in health care will not be replaceable. Therefore, chatbots have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice by working alongside health practitioners to reduce costs, refine workflow efficiencies, and improve patient outcomes. Other applications in pandemic support, global health, and education are yet to be fully explored.

However, SARS-CoV-2 is contagious multiple days before symptom onset and diagnosis, thus enhancing its transmission through the population. Methods In this retrospective study, we collected 15 seconds to one-minute heart rate and steps interval data from Fitbit devices during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 until June 2020). Resting heart rate was computed by selecting the heart rate intervals where steps were zero for 12 minutes ahead of an interrogated time point. Data for each participant was divided into train or baseline by taking the days before the non-infectious period and test data by taking the days during the COVID-19 infectious period. Data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training days. Here, we developed a deep learning approach based on a Long Short-Term Memory Networks-based autoencoder, called LAAD, to predict COVID-19 infection by detecting abnormal resting heart rate in test data relative to the user baseline. Findings We detected an abnormal resting heart rate during the period of viral infection (7 days before the symptom onset and 21 days after) in 92% (23 out of 25 cases) of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. In 56% (14) of cases, LAAD detection identified cases in their pre-symptomatic phase whereas 36% (9 cases) were detected after the onset of symptoms with an average precision score of 0.91, recall score of 0.36 and F-beta score of 0.79. In COVID-19 positive patients, abnormal RHR patterns start 5 days before symptom onset (6.9 days in pre-symptomatic cases and 1.9 days later in post-symptomatic cases). COVID-19 positive patients have longer abnormal resting heart rate periods (89 hours or 3.7 days) as compared to healthy individuals (25 hours or 1.1 days). Interpretation These findings show that deep learning neural networks and wearables data are an effective method for the early detection of COVID-19 infection. Additional validation data will help guide the use of this and similar techniques in real-world infection surveillance and isolation policies to reduce transmission and end the pandemic.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/09/2021.01.08.21249474.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249474?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249474, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nowadays, one of the most important and creative developments is the integration of AI and Blockchain that is, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to enable better and decentralized governance. Privacy and security is a critical piece in EHR implementation and/or adoption. Health records are updated every time a patient visits a doctor as they contain important information about the health and wellbeing of the patient and describes the history of care received during the past and to date. Therefore, such records are critical to research, hospitals, emergency rooms, healthcare laboratories, and even health insurance providers. Methods In this article, a platform employing the AI and the use of multi-agent based systems along with the DLT technology for privacy preservation is proposed. The emphasis of security and privacy is highlighted during the process of collecting, managing and distributing EHR data. Results This article aims to ensure privacy, integrity and security metrics of the electronic health records are met when such copies are not only immutable but also distributed. The findings of this work will help guide the development of further techniques using the combination of AI and multi-agent based systems backed by DLT technology for secure and effective handling EHR data. This proposed architecture uses various AI-based intelligent based agents and blockchain for providing privacy and security in EHR.

Materials and Methods Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient\u2019s set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist\u2019s review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10 716 individual patients (133 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. Results While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively). Discussion Our innovative digital tool was notably more accurate than existing techniques (CDS system and multicriteria query) at intercepting potential prescription errors. Conclusions By primarily targeting high-risk patients, this novel hybrid decision support system improved the accuracy and reliability of prescription checks in a hospital setting.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-pdf/27/11/1688/34363832/ocaa154.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7671619, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is most relevant for the care provider and insurer as well as for the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors. Although the broad economic impact of digital health solutions in general has been assessed many times in literature and the benefit for patients and society has also been analyzed, the specific economic impact of AI in health care has been addressed only sporadically. Objective This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the cost-effectiveness studies dedicated to AI in health care and to assess whether they meet the established quality criteria. Methods In a first step, the quality criteria for economic impact studies were defined based on the established and adapted criteria schemes for cost impact assessments. In a second step, a systematic literature review based on qualitative and quantitative inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted to identify relevant publications for an in-depth analysis of the economic impact assessment. In a final step, the quality of the identified economic impact studies was evaluated based on the defined quality criteria for cost-effectiveness studies. Results Very few publications have thoroughly addressed the economic impact assessment, and the economic assessment quality of the reviewed publications on AI shows severe methodological deficits. Only 6 out of 66 publications could be included in the second step of the analysis based on the inclusion criteria. Out of these 6 studies, none comprised a methodologically complete cost impact analysis. There are two areas for improvement in future studies. First, the initial investment and operational costs for the AI infrastructure and service need to be included. Second, alternatives to achieve similar impact must be evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison. Conclusions This systematic literature analysis proved that the existing impact assessments show methodological deficits and that upcoming evaluations require more comprehensive economic analyses to enable economic decisions for or against implementing AI technology in health care.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.2196/16866", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7059082, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Organizational learning has been a key role in improving the use of big data analytics with EHRs. Drawing on the knowledge-based view and big data lifecycle, we investigate how the three modes of knowledge can achieve meaningful use of big data analytics with EHRs. To test the associations in the proposed research model, we surveyed 580 nurses of a large hospital in China in 2019. Structural equation modelling was used to examine relationships between knowledge mode of EHRs and meaningful use of EHRs. The results reveal that know-what about EHRs utilization, know-how EHRs storage and utilization, and know-why storage and utilization can improve nurses\u2019 meaningful use of big data analytics with EHRs. This study contributes to the existing digital health and big data literature by exploring the proper adaptation of analytical tools to EHRs from the different knowledge mode in order to shape meaningful use of big data analytics with EHRs.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08824131.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939158?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939158, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life sciences companies.

Recent progress in artificial intelligence has made a positive impact on the drug development pipeline. Numerous challenges have been addressed with the growing exploitation of drug-related data and the advancement of deep learning technology. Several model frameworks have been proposed to enhance the performance of deep learning algorithms in molecular design. However, only a few have had an immediate impact on drug development since computational results may not be confirmed experimentally. This systematic review aims to summarize the different deep learning architectures used in the drug discovery process and are validated with further in vivo experiments. For each presented study, the proposed molecule or peptide that has been generated or identified by the deep learning model has been biologically evaluated in animal models. These state-of-the-art studies highlight that even if artificial intelligence in drug discovery is still in its infancy, it has great potential to accelerate the drug discovery cycle, reduce the required costs, and contribute to the integration of the 3R (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) principles. Out of all the reviewed scientific articles, seven algorithms were identified: recurrent neural networks, specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM-RNNs), Autoencoders (AEs) and their Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) variants; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Direct Message Passing Neural Networks (D-MPNNs); and Multitask Deep Neural Networks (MTDNNs).

The \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d outbreak, caused by the virus \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u201d, corresponds to the current and global pandemic, characterized by several developing variants, many of which are classified as variants of concern (VOCs) by the \u201cWorld Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland)\u201d. The primary diagnosis of infection is made using either the molecular technique of RT-PCR, which detects parts of the viral genome\u2019s RNA, or immunodiagnostic procedures, which identify viral proteins or antibodies generated by the host. As the demand for the RT-PCR test grew fast, several inexperienced producers joined the market with innovative kits, and an increasing number of laboratories joined the diagnostic field, rendering the test results increasingly prone to mistakes. It is difficult to determine how the outcomes of one unnoticed result could influence decisions about patient quarantine and social isolation, particularly when the patients themselves are health care providers. The development of point-of-care testing helps in the rapid in-field diagnosis of the disease, and such testing can also be used as a bedside monitor for mapping the progression of the disease in critical patients. In this review, we have provided the readers with available molecular diagnostic techniques and their pitfalls in detecting emerging VOCs of SARS-CoV-2, and lastly, we have discussed AI-ML- and nanotechnology-based smart diagnostic techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/11/2/374/pdf?version=1676632953", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960989, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There are various causes of cancer, and the prognostic information varies in each patient because of unique molecular signatures in the human body. However, genetic heterogeneity occurs due to different cancer types and changes in the neoplasms, which complicates the diagnosis and treatment. Targeted drug delivery is considered a pivotal contributor to precision medicine for cancer treatments as this method helps deliver medication to patients by systematically increasing the drug concentration on the targeted body parts. In such cases, nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) can help bridge the gap and enhance localized drug delivery systems capable of biomarker sensing. Diagnostic assays using nanoparticles (NPs) enable biomarker identification by accumulating in the specific cancer sites and ensuring accurate drug delivery planning. Integrating NPs for cancer targeting and AI can help devise sophisticated systems that further classify cancer types and understand complex disease patterns. Advanced AI algorithms can also help in biomarker detection, predicting different NP interactions of the targeted drug, and evaluating drug efficacy. Considering the advantages of the convergence of NPs and AI for targeted drug delivery, there has been significantly limited research focusing on the specific research theme, with most of the research being proposed on AI and drug discovery. Thus, the study's primary objective is to highlight the recent advances in drug delivery using NPs, and their impact on personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. In addition, a focal point of the study is also to highlight how integrating AI, and NPs can help address some of the existing challenges in drug delivery by conducting a collective survey.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmedt.2022.1067144/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853978, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With advances in medicine and drug dosimetry, the precise dose adjustment of chemotherapy drugs has become a significant challenge. Several academics have investigated this problem in depth. However, these studies have concentrated on the efficiency of cancer treatment while ignoring other significant bodily indicators in the patient, which could cause other complications. Therefore, to handle the above problem, this research creatively proposes a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning. First, in order to balance the competing indications inside the optimization process and to give each indicator a better outcome, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making strategy based on the integration concept. In addition, we provide a novel multi-indicator experience replay for multi-objective deep reinforcement learning, which significantly speeds up learning compared to conventional approaches. By modeling various indications in the body of the patient, our approach is used to simulate the treatment of tumors.

AI is a versatile tool that contains multiple algorithms that can be applied in various circumstances. Solid dosage forms, represented by tablets, capsules, powder, granules, etc., are among the most widely used administration methods. During the product development process, multiple factors including critical material attributes (CMAs) and processing parameters can affect product properties, such as dissolution rates, physical and chemical stabilities, particle size distribution, and the aerosol performance of the dry powder. However, the conventional trial-and-error approach for product development is inefficient, laborious, and time-consuming. AI has been recently recognized as an emerging and cutting-edge tool for pharmaceutical formulation development which has gained much attention. This review provides the following insights: (1) a general introduction of AI in the pharmaceutical sciences and principal guidance from the regulatory agencies, (2) approaches to generating a database for solid dosage formulations, (3) insight on data preparation and processing, (4) a brief introduction to and comparisons of AI algorithms, and (5) information on applications and case studies of AI as applied to solid dosage forms. In addition, the powerful technique known as deep learning-based image analytics will be discussed along with its pharmaceutical applications. By applying emerging AI technology, scientists and researchers can better understand and predict the properties of drug formulations to facilitate more efficient drug product development processes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/11/2257/pdf?version=1668420871", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9694557, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analysis using PM provides mechanistic insight into biological processes but is time- and labor-intensive. In contrast, ML models are much quicker trained, but offer less mechanistic insights. The opportunity of using ML predictions of drug PK as input for a PKPD model could strongly accelerate analysis efforts. Here exemplified by rifampicin, a widely used antibiotic, we explore the ability of different ML algorithms to predict drug PK. Based on simulated data, we trained linear regressions (LASSO), Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost and Random Forest to predict the plasma concentration-time series and rifampicin area under the concentration-versus-time curve from 0\u201324 h (AUC0\u201324h) after repeated dosing. XGBoost performed best for prediction of the entire PK series (R2: 0.84, root mean square error (RMSE): 6.9 mg/L, mean absolute error (MAE): 4.0 mg/L) for the scenario with the largest data size. For AUC0\u201324h prediction, LASSO showed the highest performance (R2: 0.97, RMSE: 29.1 h\u00b7mg/L, MAE: 18.8 h\u00b7mg/L). Increasing the number of plasma concentrations per patient (0, 2 or 6 concentrations per occasion) improved model performance. For example, for AUC0\u201324h prediction using LASSO, the R2 was 0.41, 0.69 and 0.97 when using predictors only (no plasma concentrations), 2 or 6 plasma concentrations per occasion as input, respectively. Run times for the ML models ranged from 1.0 s to 8 min, while the run time for the PM model was more than 3 h. Furthermore, building a PM model is more time- and labor-intensive compared with ML. ML predictions of drug PK could thus be used as input into a PKPD model, enabling time-efficient analysis.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/8/1530/pdf?version=1660035046", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9330804, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The challenges of widespread AI applications need to be considered from both the AI (internal problems) and the societal (external problems) perspective. This consideration will identify the priority steps for more intensive practical application of AI technologies, their introduction, and involvement in industry and society.

The SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant problems to medical systems and healthcare facilities due to its unexpected global expansion. Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques, and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time. However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5\u201315 years to 1\u20132 years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human coronavirus by using different datasets. The AI tools and computational approaches have led to speedy research and the development of a vaccine to fight against the coronavirus. Therefore, this paper suggests the role of artificial intelligence in the field of clinical trials of vaccines and clinical practices using different tools.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/7205241.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9279074, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Researchers in different fields who attempt to provide the solutions to improve AI's transparency articulate different but neighboring concepts that include, besides transparency, explainability and interpretability. Yet, there is no common taxonomy neither within one field (such as data science) nor between different fields (law and data science). In certain areas like healthcare, the requirements of transparency are crucial since the decisions directly affect people's lives. In this paper, we suggest an interdisciplinary vision on how to tackle the issue of AI's transparency in healthcare, and we propose a single point of reference for both legal scholars and data scientists on transparency and related concepts. Based on the analysis of the European Union (EU) legislation and literature in computer science, we submit that transparency shall be considered the \u201cway of thinking\u201d and umbrella concept characterizing the process of AI's development and use. Transparency shall be achieved through a set of measures such as interpretability and explainability, communication, auditability, traceability, information provision, record-keeping, data governance and management, and documentation. This approach to deal with transparency is of general nature, but transparency measures shall be always contextualized. By analyzing transparency in the healthcare context, we submit that it shall be viewed as a system of accountabilities of involved subjects (AI developers, healthcare professionals, and patients) distributed at different layers (insider, internal, and external layers, respectively). The transparency-related accountabilities shall be built-in into the existing accountability picture which justifies the need to investigate the relevant legal frameworks. These frameworks correspond to different layers of the transparency system. The requirement of informed medical consent correlates to the external layer of transparency and the Medical Devices Framework is relevant to the insider and internal layers. We investigate the said frameworks to inform AI developers on what is already expected from them with regards to transparency. We also discover the gaps in the existing legislative frameworks concerning AI's transparency in healthcare and suggest the solutions to fill them in.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.879603/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9189302, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Unlike modern medicine, Ayurveda is based upon tridoshas (Vata, pitta, and Kapha) and Prakriti. On the other hand, the research of all the genes involved at the proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptome levels are referred to as genomics. Geoclimatic regions (deshanupatini), familial characteristics (kulanupatini), and ethnicity (jatiprasakta) have all been shown to affect phenotypic variability. The combination of genomics with Ayurveda known as ayurgenomics provided new insights into tridosha that may pave the way for precision medicine (personalized medicine). Through successful coordination of \u201comics,\u201d Prakriti-based treatments can help change the existing situation in health care. Prakriti refers to an individual\u2019s behavioral trait, which is established at the moment of birth and cannot be fully altered during one\u2019s existence. Ayurvedic methodologies are based on three Prakriti aspects: aushadhi (medication), vihara (lifestyle), and ahara (diet). A foundation of Prakriti-based medicine, preventative medicine, and improvement of life quality with longevity can be accomplished through these ayurvedic characteristics. In this perspective, we try to understand prakriti\u2019s use in personalized medicine, and how to integrate it with programs for drug development and discovery.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.866827/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9011054, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this regard, progress in the generation of data describing antigen binding and developability, computational methodology, and artificial intelligence may pave the way for a new era of in silico on-demand immunotherapeutics design and discovery. Here, we argue that the main necessary machine learning (ML) components for an in silico mAb sequence generator are: understanding of the rules of mAb-antigen binding, capacity to modularly combine mAb design parameters, and algorithms for unconstrained parameter-driven in silico mAb sequence synthesis. We review the current progress toward the realization of these necessary components and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to allow the on-demand ML-based discovery and design of fit-for-purpose mAb therapeutic candidates.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19420862.2021.2008790?needAccess=true", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8928824, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Strategies on how to improve NP tumor delivery efficiency remain to be determined. Methods This study analyzed the roles of NP physicochemical properties, tumor models, and cancer types in NP tumor delivery efficiency using multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, using data from a recently published Nano-Tumor Database that contains 376 datasets generated from a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Results The deep neural network model adequately predicted the delivery efficiency of different NPs to different tumors and it outperformed all other machine learning methods; including random forest, support vector machine, linear regression, and bagged model methods. The adjusted determination coefficients (R2) in the full training dataset were 0.92, 0.77, 0.77 and 0.76 for the maximum delivery efficiency (DEmax), delivery efficiency at 24 h (DE24), at 168 h (DE168), and at the last sampling time (DETlast). The corresponding R2 values in the test dataset were 0.70, 0.46, 0.33 and 0.63, respectively. Also, this study showed that cancer type was an important determinant for the deep neural network model in predicting the tumor delivery efficiency across all endpoints (19\u201329%). Among all physicochemical properties, the Zeta potential and core material played a greater role than other properties, such as the type, shape, and targeting strategy. Conclusion This study provides a quantitative model to improve the design of cancer nanomedicine with greater tumor delivery efficiency. These results help to improve our understanding of the causes of low NP tumor delivery efficiency. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating artificial intelligence with PBPK modeling approaches to study cancer nanomedicine.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=79329", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8961007, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Demand for ODTs has increased, and the field has overgrown in the pharmaceutical industry and academia. It is reported that ODTs have several advantages over other conventional tablets. Since some of them are absorbed from the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus as the saliva passes down into the stomach, in such cases, the bioavailability of the drug improves meaningfully. Furthermore, the immediate release property of ODTs makes them a popular oral dosage form in patients with swallowing challenges, children, and for cases with a need for rapid onset of action. The current review article explains the features of active ingredients and excipients used in the formulation of ODTs, discusses multiple ODT formulation and preparation techniques with their merits and demerits, and also, offers remedies for problems associated with ODTs.

State-of-the-art computational vHTS necessarily relies on effective methods for pose sampling and docking and generating an accurate affinity score from the docked poses. However, proteins are dynamic; invivo ligands bind to a conformational ensemble. In silico docking to the single conformation represented by a crystal structure can adversely affect the pose quality. Here, we introduce AtomNet PoseRanker (ANPR), a graph convolutional network trained to identify and rerank crystal-like ligand poses from a sampled ensemble of protein conformations and ligand poses. In contrast to conventional vHTS methods that incorporate receptor flexibility, a deep learning approach can internalize valid cognate and noncognate binding modes corresponding to distinct receptor conformations, thereby learning to infer and account for receptor flexibility even on single conformations. ANPR significantly enriched pose quality in docking to cognate and noncognate receptors of the PDBbind v2019 data set. Improved pose rankings that better represent experimentally observed ligand binding modes improve hit rates in vHTS campaigns and thereby advance computational drug discovery, especially for novel therapeutic targets or novel binding sites.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://escholarship.org/content/qt4dv0f2w6/qt4dv0f2w6.pdf?t=rx301a", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8924924, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This strategy allows the clarification of mechanism of action and biological activities of compounds whose target is still unknown. Moreover, target fishing can be employed for the identification of off targets of drug candidates, thus recognizing and preventing their possible adverse effects. For these reasons, target fishing has increasingly become a key approach for polypharmacology, drug repurposing, and the identification of new drug targets. While experimental target fishing can be lengthy and difficult to implement, due to the plethora of interactions that may occur for a single small-molecule with different protein targets, an in silico approach can be quicker, less expensive, more efficient for specific protein structures, and thus easier to employ. Moreover, the possibility to use it in combination with docking and virtual screening studies, as well as the increasing number of web-based tools that have been recently developed, make target fishing a more appealing method for drug discovery. It is especially worth underlining the increasing implementation of machine learning in this field, both as a main target fishing approach and as a further development of already applied strategies. This review reports on the main in silico target fishing strategies, belonging to both ligand-based and receptor-based approaches, developed and applied in the last years, with a particular attention to the different web tools freely accessible by the scientific community for performing target fishing studies.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/17/5124/pdf?version=1629815392", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8433825, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The aim of this narrative review was to describe: (1) studies on AI tools that can be used to measure and increase medication adherence in patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs); (2) the benefits of using AI for these purposes; (3) challenges of the use of AI in healthcare; and (4) priorities for future research. We discuss the current AI technologies, including mobile phone applications, reminder systems, tools for patient empowerment, instruments that can be used in integrated care, and machine learning. The use of AI may be key to understanding the complex interplay of factors that underly medication non-adherence in NCD patients. AI-assisted interventions aiming to improve communication between patients and physicians, monitor drug consumption, empower patients, and ultimately, increase adherence levels may lead to better clinical outcomes and increase the quality of life of NCD patients. However, the use of AI in healthcare is challenged by numerous factors; the characteristics of users can impact the effectiveness of an AI tool, which may lead to further inequalities in healthcare, and there may be concerns that it could depersonalize medicine. The success and widespread use of AI technologies will depend on data storage capacity, processing power, and other infrastructure capacities within healthcare systems. Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI solutions in different patient groups and establish the barriers to widespread adoption, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a rapid increase in the use and development of digital health technologies.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2021.669869/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8521858, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

That it was possible to develop multiple COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year, while at the same time fostering extreme inequities, calls for transformative change in the health innovation and access ecosystem. Brought into the spotlight through the AIDS drugs access crisis, challenges in accessing lifesaving medicines and vaccines\u2014because they are either not available or inaccessible due to excessive pricing\u2014are being faced by people all over the world. To appreciate the underlying framing of current access discussions, it is important to understand past trends in global health policies and the thinking behind the institutions and mechanisms that were designed to solve access problems. Contrary to what might be expected, certain types of solutions intrinsically carry the conditions that enable scarcity, rationing, and inequity, and lead us away from ensuring the right to health. Analyzing the root causes of access problems and the political economy that allows them to persist and even become exacerbated is necessary to fix access inequities today and to design better solutions to ensure equitable access to health technologies in the future.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233016, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

DDI occurs when food, drinks, chemicals, and other drugs change the effectiveness of a drug that is given simultaneously. One type of DDI is pharmacodynamics interactions. This interaction is difficult to detect and is very dangerous to humans. Therefore it is necessary to do classification modeling to identify pharmacodynamics interactions based on the value of Side Effect Similarity (SES), Chemical Similarity (CS), and Target Protein Connectedness (TPC). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and random forest classification method that can be used to predict pharmacodynamics interactions. This study aims to find the best classifications technique by first applying the scaling process, variables interaction, resampling technique, and binarization technique. Best on the analysis result obtained by the random forest is the best model with the highest accuracy and AUC value to other models. The accuracy and AUC values for the best models are 89.93% and 79.96%.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1863/1/012067", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1088/1742-6596/1863/1/012067?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1863/1/012067, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It includes multiple unit operations, such as mixing, granulation, and tableting. In tablet manufacturing, critical quality attributes are influenced by multiple factorial relationships between material properties, process variables, and interactions. Moreover, the variation in raw material attributes and manufacturing processes is an inherent characteristic and seriously affects the quality of pharmaceutical products. To deepen our understanding of the tablet manufacturing process, multivariable modeling techniques can replace univariate analysis to investigate tablet manufacturing. In this review, the roles of the most prominent multivariate modeling techniques in the tablet manufacturing process are discussed. The review mainly focuses on applying multivariate modeling techniques to process understanding, optimization, process monitoring, and process control within multiple unit operations. To minimize the errors in the process of modeling, good modeling practice (GMoP) was introduced into the pharmaceutical process. Furthermore, current progress in the continuous manufacturing of tablets and the role of multivariate modeling techniques in continuous manufacturing are introduced. In this review, information is provided to both researchers and manufacturers to improve tablet quality.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/ra/d0ra08030f", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8695199, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There are many technologies emerging to cause this paradigm shift from the conventional \u201cone size fits all\u201d to personalized medicine, the major one being three-dimensional (3D) printing. 3D printing involves the establishment of a three-dimensional object, in a layer upon layer manner using various computer software. 3D printing can be used to construct a wide variety of pharmaceutical dosage forms varying in shape, release profile, and drug combination. The major technological platforms of 3D printing researched on in the pharmaceutical sector include inkjet printing, binder jetting, fused filament fabrication, selective laser sintering, stereolithography, and pressure-assisted microsyringe. A possible future application of this technology could be in a clinical setting, where prescriptions could be dispensed based on individual needs. This manuscript points out the various 3D printing technologies and their applications in research for fabricating pharmaceutical products, along with their pros and cons. It also presents its potential in personalized medicine by individualizing the dose, release profiles, and incorporating multiple drugs in a polypill. An insight on how it tends to various populations is also provided. An approach of how it can be used in a clinical setting is also highlighted. Also, various challenges faced are pointed out, which must be overcome for the success of this technology in personalized medicine.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1208/s12249-020-01905-8.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7811988, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML\u2010driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML\u2010powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art of AI/ML\u2010guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood\u2013brain barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for neurological diseases.

Such kind of novelty has to be mainly acknowledged in the area of AI and Computer Science. Methodological papers deal with the proposal of some strategy and related methods to solve some scientific issues in specific domains. They must show, usually through an experimental evaluation, how the proposed methodology can be applied to medicine, medicallyoriented human biology, and health care, respectively. They have also to provide a comparison with other proposals, and explicitly discuss elements of novelty. Theoretical papers focus on more fundamental, general and formal topics of AI and must show the novel expected effects of the proposed solution in some medical or healthcare field.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": "CCBYNCSA", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10824127, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of\n data-centric AI\n . The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems. A companion list of data-centric AI resources will be regularly updated on https://github.com/daochenzha/data-centric-AI\n", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10158", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10158, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, the low concentration of relevant blood-based biosources and the heterogeneity of samples (i.e. the variability of relative abundance of molecules identified), pose major challenges to biomarker discovery. Moreover, the number of molecular measurements or features (e.g., transcript read counts) per sample could be in the order of several thousand, whereas the number of samples is often substantially lower, leading to the curse of dimensionality. These challenges, among others, elucidate the importance of a robust biomarker panel identification or feature extraction step wherein relevant molecular measurements are identified prior to classification for cancer detection. In this work, we performed a benchmarking study on eleven feature extraction methods using transcriptomic profiles derived from different blood-based biosources. The methods were assessed both in terms of their predictive performance and the robustness of the biomarker panels in diagnosing cancer or stratifying cancer subtypes. While performing the comparison, the feature extraction methods are categorised into feature subset selection methods and transformation methods. A transformation feature extraction method, namely PLS-DA, was found to perform consistently superior in terms of classification performance, while a feature subset selection method, namely Ranger, selected feature sets that were the most robust to sub-sampling in terms of consistently selecting the same features. As part of the benchmarking study, a generic pipeline has been created and made available as an R package to ensure reproducibility of the results and allow for easy extension of this study to other datasets.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.13.483368", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1101/2022.03.13.483368?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.13.483368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One shortcoming of CNNs, however, is their lack of generalizability and tendency to overfit when presented with small training sets. Augmentation directly confronts this problem by generating new data points providing additional information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of more than ten different sets of data augmentation methods, with two novel approaches proposed here: one based on the discrete wavelet transform and the other on the constant-Q Gabor transform. Pretrained ResNet50 networks are finetuned on each augmentation method. Combinations of these networks are evaluated and compared across four benchmark data sets of images representing diverse problems and collected by instruments that capture information at different scales: a virus data set, a bark data set, a portrait dataset, and a LIGO glitches data set. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach. The best ensemble proposed in this work achieves state-of-the-art (or comparable) performance across all four data sets. This result shows that varying data augmentation is a feasible way for building an ensemble of classifiers for image classification.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/7/12/254/pdf?version=1637998888", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8707550, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We compare 14 filter methods for feature selection based on 11 high-dimensional gene expression survival data sets. The aim is to provide guidance on the choice of filter methods for other researchers and practitioners. We analyze the accuracy of predictive models that employ the features selected by the filter methods. Also, we consider the run time, the number of selected features for fitting models with high predictive accuracy as well as the feature selection stability. We conclude that the simple variance filter outperforms all other considered filter methods. This filter selects the features with the largest variance and does not take into account the survival outcome. Also, we identify the correlation-adjusted regression scores filter as a more elaborate alternative that allows fitting models with similar predictive accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the filter methods based on feature rankings, finding groups of similar filters.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-pdf/23/1/bbab354/42229629/bbab354.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8769710, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In the recent past, much literature has demonstrated machine learning approaches as an opportunity to efficiently diagnose heart disease patients. However, challenges associated with datasets such as missing data, inconsistent data, and mixed data (containing inconsistent missing data both as numerical and categorical) are often obstacles in medical diagnosis. This inconsistency led to a higher probability of misprediction and a misled result. Data preprocessing steps like feature reduction, data conversion, and data scaling are employed to form a standard dataset\u2014such measures play a crucial role in reducing inaccuracy in final prediction. This paper aims to evaluate eleven machine learning (ML) algorithms\u2014Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), AdaBoost (AB), Extra Tree Classifier (ET)\u2014and six different data scaling methods\u2014Normalization (NR), Standscale (SS), MinMax (MM), MaxAbs (MA), Robust Scaler (RS), and Quantile Transformer (QT) on a dataset comprising of information of patients with heart disease. The result shows that CART, along with RS or QT, outperforms all other ML algorithms with 100% accuracy, 100% precision, 99% recall, and 100% F1 score. The study outcomes demonstrate that the model\u2019s performance varies depending on the data scaling method.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/9/3/52/pdf?version=1627349465", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/TECHNOLOGIES9030052?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/TECHNOLOGIES9030052, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The importance of data quality has been recognized beyond the field of data engineering and database management systems (DBMSs). Also, for machine learning (ML) applications, high data quality standards are crucial to ensure robust predictive performance and responsible usage of automated decision making. One of the most frequent data quality problems is missing values. Incomplete datasets can break data pipelines and can have a devastating impact on downstream ML applications when not detected. While statisticians and, more recently, ML researchers have introduced a variety of approaches to impute missing values, comprehensive benchmarks comparing classical and modern imputation approaches under fair and realistic conditions are underrepresented. Here, we aim to fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments on a large number of datasets with heterogeneous data and realistic missingness conditions, comparing both novel deep learning approaches and classical ML imputation methods when either only test or train and test data are affected by missing data. Each imputation method is evaluated regarding the imputation quality and the impact imputation has on a downstream ML task. Our results provide valuable insights into the performance of a variety of imputation methods under realistic conditions. We hope that our results help researchers and engineers to guide their data preprocessing method selection for automated data quality improvement.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2021.693674/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8297389, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive and unifying survey of data augmentation for NLP by summarizing the literature in a structured manner. We first introduce and motivate data augmentation for NLP, and then discuss major methodologically representative approaches. Next, we highlight techniques that are used for popular NLP applications and tasks. We conclude by outlining current challenges and directions for future research. Overall, our paper aims to clarify the landscape of existing literature in data augmentation for NLP and motivate additional work in this area.

Recent studies report that prompt-based direct classification eliminates the need for fine-tuning but lacks data and inference scalability. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation technique that leverages large-scale language models to generate realistic text samples from a mixture of real samples. We also propose utilizing soft-labels predicted by the language models, effectively distilling knowledge from the large-scale language models and creating textual perturbations simultaneously. We perform data augmentation experiments on diverse classification tasks and show that our method hugely outperforms existing text augmentation methods.

In this work, we propose a method for automatically rewriting queries into \u201cBERTese\u201d, a paraphrase query that is directly optimized towards better knowledge extraction. To encourage meaningful rewrites, we add auxiliary loss functions that encourage the query to correspond to actual language tokens.

This has become a topic of recent interest as a way to query a trained model and suggest possible actions to overturn its decision. Mathematically, the problem is formally equivalent to that of finding adversarial examples, which also has attracted significant attention recently. Most work on either counterfactual explanations or adversarial examples has focused on differentiable classifiers, such as neural nets. We focus on classification trees, both axis-aligned and oblique (having hyperplane splits). Although here the counterfactual optimization problem is nonconvex and nondifferentiable, we show that an exact solution can be computed very efficiently, even with high-dimensional feature vectors and with both continuous and categorical features, and demonstrate it in different datasets and settings.

We present LM-BFF\u2014better few-shot fine-tuning of language models\u2014a suite of simple and complementary techniques for fine-tuning language models on a small number of annotated examples. Our approach includes (1) prompt-based fine-tuning together with a novel pipeline for automating prompt generation; and (2) a refined strategy for dynamically and selectively incorporating demonstrations into each context. Finally, we present a systematic evaluation for analyzing few-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks, including classification and regression. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods combine to dramatically outperform standard fine-tuning procedures in this low resource setting, achieving up to 30% absolute improvement, and 11% on average across all tasks.

We focus on feature selection using the classical mutual information criterion, which selects the k features with the largest mutual information with the label. In the active feature selection setting, the goal is to use significantly fewer labels than the data set size and still find k features whose mutual information with the label based on the entire data set is large. We explain and experimentally study the choices that we make in the algorithm, and show that they lead to a successful algorithm, compared to other more naive approaches. Our design draws on insights which relate the problem of active feature selection to the study of pure-exploration multi-armed bandits settings. While we focus here on mutual information, our general methodology can be adapted to other feature-quality measures as well.

Cost-benefit analysis over 10,000 judgments collected on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk suggests a win-win. Firstly, rationales yield a multitude of benefits: more reliable judgments, greater transparency for evaluating both human raters and their judgments, reduced need for expert gold, the opportunity for dual-supervision from ratings and rationales, and added value from the rationales themselves. Secondly, once experienced in the task, crowd workers provide rationales with almost no increase in task completion time.

However, enormous amounts of compute are required for training and applying such big models, resulting in a large carbon footprint and making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to use them. We show that performance similar to GPT-3 can be obtained with language models that are much \u201cgreener\u201d in that their parameter count is several orders of magnitude smaller. This is achieved by converting textual inputs into cloze questions that contain a task description, combined with gradient-based optimization; exploiting unlabeled data gives further improvements.

When new search algorithms are proposed in past work, the attack search space is often modified alongside the search algorithm. Without ablation studies benchmarking the search algorithm change with the search space held constant, one cannot tell if an increase in attack success rate is a result of an improved search algorithm or a less restrictive search space. Additionally, many previous studies fail to properly consider the search algorithms\u2019 run-time cost, which is essential for downstream tasks like adversarial training.

Patients increasingly access online patient educational materials (OPEMs) to guide medical decision\u2010making. The American Medical Association (AMA) recommends that OPEMs should be written below a 6th\u2010grade reading level. This study estimated the readability of commonly accessed OPEMs on CAC scans. Methods and Results The terms \u201ccoronary artery calcium scan,\u201d \u201cheart scan,\u201d and \u201cCAC score\u201d were queried using an online search engine to identify the top 50 commonly accessed websites based on order of search results on December 17, 2019. Grade\u2010level readability was calculated using generalized estimating equations, with observations nested within readability metrics from each website. Results were compared with AMA\u2010recommended readability parameters. Overall grade\u2010level readability among all search terms was 10.9 (95% CI, 9.3\u201312.5). Average grade\u2010level readability of OPEMs for the search terms \u201ccoronary artery calcium scan,\u201d \u201cheart scan,\u201d and \u201cCAC score,\u201d was 10.7 (95% CI, 9.0\u201312.5), 10.5 (95% CI, 8.9\u201312.1), and 11.9 (95% CI, 10.3\u201313.5), respectively. Professional society and news/media/blog websites had the highest average reading grade level of 12.6, while health system websites had the lowest average reading grade level of 10.0. Less than half of the unique websites (45.3%) included explanatory images or videos.

Around 5 million new cases of skin cancer are recorded in the United States annually. Early identification and evaluation of skin lesions are of great clinical significance, but the disproportionate dermatologist-patient ratio poses a significant problem in most developing nations. Therefore a novel deep architecture, named as SkiNet, is proposed to provide faster screening solution and assistance to newly trained physicians in the process of clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The main motive behind SkiNet\u2019s design and development is to provide a white box solution, addressing a critical problem of trust and interpretability which is crucial for the wider adoption of Computer-aided diagnosis systems by medical practitioners. The proposed SkiNet is a two-stage pipeline wherein the lesion segmentation is followed by the lesion classification. Monte Carlo dropout and test time augmentation techniques have been employed in the proposed method to estimate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. A novel segmentation model named Bayesian MultiResUNet is used to estimate the uncertainty on the predicted segmentation map. Saliency-based methods like XRAI, Grad-CAM and Guided Backprop are explored to provide post-hoc explanations of the deep learning models. The ISIC-2018 dataset is used to perform the experimentation and ablation studies. The results establish the robustness of the proposed model on the traditional benchmarks while addressing the black-box nature of such models to alleviate the skepticism of medical practitioners by incorporating transparency and confidence to the model\u2019s prediction.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0276836&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9621459, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Unfortunately, its corresponding area of machine learning is still relatively in its infancy, and the solutions currently offered do not specialize well in concrete usage scenarios. Specifically, they do not take existing \u201cexpert\u201d knowledge about the domain world into account; and that might indeed be necessary in order to provide the level of reliability demanded by the use case scenarios. In this paper, we propose an initial approximation to a framework called Ontology-Guided Scene Graph Generation (OG-SGG), that can improve the performance of an existing machine learning based scene graph generator using prior knowledge supplied in the form of an ontology (specifically, using the axioms defined within); and we present results evaluated on a specific scenario founded in telepresence robotics. These results show quantitative and qualitative improvements in the generated scene graphs.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09991965.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10201, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It does so according to an interdisciplinary approach, i.e. by departing from the philosophical concept of explainability and discussing some metrics proposed by scholars and standardisation entities through the lenses of the explainability obligations set by the proposed AI Act. Our analysis proposes that metrics to measure the kind of explainability endorsed by the proposed AI Act shall be risk-focused, model-agnostic, goal-aware, intelligible & accessible. This is why we discuss the extent to which these requirements are met by the metrics currently under discussion.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/FAIA210342", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11168, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

LIME typically creates an explanation for a single prediction by any ML model by learning a simpler interpretable model (e.g., linear classifier) around the prediction through generating simulated data around the instance by random perturbation, and obtaining feature importance through applying some form of feature selection. While LIME and similar local algorithms have gained popularity due to their simplicity, the random perturbation methods result in shifts in data and instability in the generated explanations, where for the same prediction, different explanations can be generated. These are critical issues that can prevent deployment of LIME in sensitive domains. We propose a deterministic version of LIME. Instead of random perturbation, we utilize Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) to group the training data together and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) to select the relevant cluster of the new instance that is being explained. After finding the relevant cluster, a simple model (i.e., linear model or decision tree) is trained over the selected cluster to generate the explanations. Experimental results on six public (three binary and three multi-class) and six synthetic datasets show the superiority for Deterministic Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (DLIME), where we quantitatively determine the stability and faithfulness of DLIME compared to LIME.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/3/3/27/pdf?version=1625044194", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/make3030027?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/make3030027, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Some of these problems are classically important, and some are recent problems that have arisen in the last few years. These problems are: (1) Optimizing sparse logical models such as decision trees; (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing constraints into generalized additive models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability; (4) Modern case-based reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data visualization; (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative or causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the\"Rashomon set\"of good models; and (10) Interpretable reinforcement learning.

However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into \u201cblack box\u201d approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/1/18/pdf?version=1609160444", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7824368, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A C5.0 is trained to recognize four classes using common features. The four classes are (i) atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, (ii) tachycardias (iii), sinus bradycardia and (iv) sinus rhythm. Data from 10,646 subjects, 83% of whom have at least one arrhythmia and 17% of whom exhibit a normal sinus rhythm, are used. The C5.0 is trained using 10-fold cross-validation and is able to achieve a balanced accuracy of 95.35%. By using the white-box machine learning approach, a clear and comprehensible tree structure can be revealed, which has selected the 5 most important features from a total of 24 features. These 5 features are ventricular rate, RR-Interval variation, atrial rate, age and difference between longest and shortest RR-Interval. The combination of ventricular rate, RR-Interval variation and atrial rate is especially relevant to achieve classification accuracy, which can be disclosed through the tree. The tree assigns unique values to distinguish the classes. These findings could be applied in medicine in the future. It can be shown that a white-box machine learning approach can reveal granular structures, thus confirming known linear relationships and also revealing nonlinear relationships. To highlight the strength of the C5.0 with respect to this structural revelation, the results of further white-box machine learning and black-box machine learning algorithms are presented.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243615&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7746264, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The explainable AI (xAI) field is rapidly expanding with numerous ways of extracting information and visualizing the output of AI technologies (e.g. deep neural networks).

We conduct a systematic review of xAI literature on the topic and identify four thematic debates central to how xAI addresses the black-box problem. Based on this critical analysis of the xAI scholarship we synthesize the findings into a future research agenda to further the xAI body of knowledge.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/70768/1/0127.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01007, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The decision-making behind the black boxes requires it to be more transparent, accountable, and understandable for humans. This survey paper provides essential definitions, an overview of the different principles and methodologies of explainable Supervised Machine Learning (SML). We conduct a state-of-the-art survey that reviews past and recent explainable SML approaches and classifies them according to the introduced definitions.

While explainability in AI has recently received significant attention, the origins of this line of work go back several decades to when AI systems were mainly developed as (knowledge\u2010based) expert systems. Since then, the definition, understanding, and implementation of explainability have been picked up in several lines of research work, namely, expert systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and in approaches to neural\u2010symbolic learning and reasoning, mostly happening during different periods of AI history. In this article, we present a historical perspective of Explainable Artificial Intelligence. We discuss how explainability was mainly conceived in the past, how it is understood in the present and, how it might be understood in the future.

Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art machine learning models can be fooled by small, maliciously crafted perturbations of their input data. Foolbox is a popular Python library to benchmark the robustness of machine learning models against these adversarial perturbations. It comes with a huge collection of state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to find adversarial perturbations and thanks to its framework-agnostic design it is ideally suited for comparing the robustness of many different models implemented in different frameworks. Foolbox 3 aka Foolbox Native has been rewritten from scratch to achieve native performance on models developed in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016), and JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), all with one codebase without code duplication.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02607.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21105/JOSS.02607?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21105/JOSS.02607, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The goal of the competition was to create a complicated black box model for the dataset and explain how it worked. One team did not follow the rules. Instead of sending in a black box, they created a model that was fully interpretable. This leads to the question of whether the real world of machine learning is similar to the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, where black box models are used even when they are not needed.

These systems\u2019s adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for significant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and verifiability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation? The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current state of the research field on machine learning interpretability while focusing on the societal impact and on the developed methods and metrics. Furthermore, a complete literature review is presented in order to identify future directions of work on this field.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/8/8/832/pdf?version=1564134847", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/ELECTRONICS8080832?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/ELECTRONICS8080832, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Its central idea is that whether AIs are trustworthy is a matter of whether they live up to their function-based obligations. We argue that this account serves to advance the literature in a couple of important ways. First, it serves to provide a rationale for why a range of properties that are widely assumed in the scientific literature, as well as in policy, to be required of trustworthy AI, such as safety, justice, and explainability, are properties (often) instantiated by trustworthy AI. Second, we connect the discussion on trustworthy AI in policy, industry, and the sciences with the philosophical discussion of trustworthiness. We argue that extant accounts of trustworthiness in the philosophy literature cannot make proper sense of trustworthy AI and that our account compares favourably with its competitors on this front.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44204-023-00063-5.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s44204-023-00063-5?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s44204-023-00063-5, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

AI is being applied in more and more fields and scenarios such as autonomous driving, medical care, media, finance, industrial robots, and internet services. The widespread application of AI and its deep integration with the economy and society have improved efficiency and produced benefits. At the same time, it will inevitably impact the existing social order and raise ethical concerns. Ethical issues, such as privacy leakage, discrimination, unemployment, and security risks, brought about by AI systems have caused great trouble to people. Therefore, AI ethics, which is a field related to the study of ethical issues in AI, has become not only an important research topic in academia, but also an important topic of common concern for individuals, organizations, countries, and society. This article will give a comprehensive overview of this field by summarizing and analyzing the ethical risks and issues raised by AI, ethical guidelines and principles issued by different organizations, approaches for addressing ethical issues in AI, and methods for evaluating the ethics of AI. Additionally, challenges in implementing ethics in AI and some future perspectives are pointed out. We hope our work will provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of AI ethics for researchers and practitioners in this field, especially the beginners of this research discipline.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/9078688/9184921/09844014.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/TAI.2022.3194503?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.2022.3194503, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A plethora of guidelines, principles, and toolkits have been published globally, but have seen limited grassroots implementation, especially among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mainly due to the lack of knowledge, skills, and resources. In this article, we report on qualitative SME consultations over two events to establish their understanding of both data and AI ethical principles and to identify the key barriers SMEs face in their adoption of ethical AI approaches. We then use independent experts to review and code 77 published toolkits designed to build and support ethical and responsible AI practices, based on 33 evaluation criteria. The toolkits were evaluated considering their scope to address the identified SME barriers to adoption, human-centric AI principles, AI life cycle stages, and key themes around responsible AI and practical usability. Toolkits were ranked on the basis of criteria coverage and expert intercoder agreement. Results show that there is not a one-size-fits-all toolkit that addresses all criteria suitable for SMEs. Our findings show few exemplars of practical application, little guidance on how to use/apply the toolkits, and very low uptake by SMEs.

Because the underlying stakeholder purposes are broadly ethical in nature, we see this analysis as a contribution towards bringing together the technical and ethical dimensions of XAI.

Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data because acquiring data involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming. This has triggered a serious debate in both the industrial and academic communities calling for more data-efficient models that harness the power of artificial learners while achieving good results with less training data and in particular less human supervision. In light of this debate, this work investigates the issue of algorithms\u2019 data hungriness. First, it surveys the issue from different perspectives. Then, it presents a comprehensive review of existing data-efficient methods and systematizes them into four categories. Specifically, the survey covers solution strategies that handle data-efficiency by (i) using non-supervised algorithms that are, by nature, more data-efficient, by (ii) creating artificially more data, by (iii) transferring knowledge from rich-data domains into poor-data domains, or by (iv) altering data-hungry algorithms to reduce their dependency upon the amount of samples, in a way they can perform well in small samples regime. Each strategy is extensively reviewed and discussed.

Despite very considerable advances in selected areas related to machine learning safety, shortcomings were identified on holistic approaches that take an end-to-end view on the risks associated to the engineering of ML-based control systems and their certification. Applying a classic technique of safety engineering, our paper provides a comprehensive and methodological analysis of the safety hazards that could be introduced along the ML lifecycle, and could compromise the safe operation of ML-based CPS. Identified hazards are illustrated and explained using a real-world application scenario\u2014an autonomous shop-floor transportation vehicle.

There is a significant amount of research into the ethical consequences of artificial intelligence (AI). This is reflected by many outputs across academia, policy and the media. Many of these outputs aim to provide guidance to particular stakeholder groups. It has recently been shown that there is a large degree of convergence in terms of the principles upon which these guidance documents are based. Despite this convergence, it is not always clear how these principles are to be translated into practice.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this paper, the authors move beyond the high-level ethical principles that are common across the AI ethics guidance literature and provide a description of the normative content that is covered by these principles. The outcome is a comprehensive compilation of normative requirements arising from existing guidance documents. This is not only required for a deeper theoretical understanding of AI ethics discussions but also for the creation of practical and implementable guidance for developers and users of AI.\n\n\nFindings\nIn this paper, the authors therefore provide a detailed explanation of the normative implications of existing AI ethics guidelines but directed towards developers and organisational users of AI. The authors believe that the paper provides the most comprehensive account of ethical requirements in AI currently available, which is of interest not only to the research and policy communities engaged in the topic but also to the user communities that require guidance when developing or deploying AI systems.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe authors believe that they have managed to compile the most comprehensive document collecting existing guidance which can guide practical action but will hopefully also support the consolidation of the guidelines landscape. The authors\u2019 findings should also be of academic interest and inspire philosophical research on the consistency and justification of the various normative statements that can be found in the literature.\n", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138/full/pdf?title=artificial-intelligence-ethics-guidelines-for-developers-and-users-clarifying-their-content-and-normative-implications", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), these decision rules have been replaced by probabilistic algorithms (e.g., deep learning; see Kraus et al. 2020). Probabilistic algorithms make inferences by learning existing patterns from data and, once deployed, provide predictions for unseen data under some uncertainty. Owing to this, they are prone to biases and systematic unfairness whereby individuals or whole groups are treated disparately. The lack of fairness in AI applications has been repeatedly demonstrated in prior research. For instance, decision support systems for credit loan applications were found to favor certain socio-demographic groups in a disproportional way (Hardt and Price 2016; O\u2019Neil 2016). As a consequence, people living in certain areas, those with a specific ethnic background, or women were less likely to obtain a loan from the bank. This can prevent whole neighborhoods from improving their standard of living and cause further economic and societal problems, thus reinforcing existing imbalances. Table 1 lists further examples of situations in which unfairness in AI could lead to discrimination against individuals or whole groups of people. The term \u2018\u2018fair AI\u2019\u2019 refers to probabilistic decision support that prevents disparate harm (or benefit) to different subgroups (Barocas and Selbst 2016). In fair AI, the objective is to provide systems that both quantify bias and mitigate discrimination against subgroups. One might be inclined to think that simply omitting sensitive attributes from a decision support system will also solve fairness issues. However, this is a common misunderstanding: several non-sensitive attributes act as proxies (e.g., salary is a proxy of gender, ZIP code is a proxy for ethnicity, family structure is proxy of race or religion) and, hence, even decision support systems without knowledge of sensitive attributes are deemed unfair. The objective of this article is to introduce IS practitioners and researchers to \u2018\u2018fair AI\u2019\u2019. As detailed above, there are various areas within IS that are prone to unfairness. In fact, information systems maintain or even reinforce existing unfairness in AI rather than mitigating it.

As a result, many organizations have launched a wide range of initiatives to establish ethical principles for the adoption of socially beneficial AI. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of proposed principles threatens to overwhelm and confuse. How might this problem of \u2018principle proliferation\u2019 be solved? In this paper, we report the results of a fine-grained analysis of several of the highest-profile sets of ethical principles for AI. We assess whether these principles converge upon a set of agreed-upon principles, or diverge, with significant disagreement over what constitutes \u2018ethical AI.\u2019 Our analysis finds a high degree of overlap among the sets of principles we analyze. We then identify an overarching framework consisting of five core principles for ethical AI. Four of them are core principles commonly used in bioethics: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. On the basis of our comparative analysis, we argue that a new principle is needed in addition: explicability, understood as incorporating both the epistemological sense of intelligibility (as an answer to the question \u2018how does it work?\u2019) and in the ethical sense of accountability (as an answer to the question: \u2018who is responsible for the way it works?\u2019). In the ensuing discussion, we note the limitations and assess the implications of this ethical framework for future efforts to create laws, rules, technical standards, and best practices for ethical AI in a wide range of contexts.KeywordsAccountability; Autonomy; Artificial Intelligence; Beneficence; Ethics; Explicability; Fairness; Intelligibility; Justice; Non-maleficence.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://assets.pubpub.org/ukqte8ry/c8d3cba5-8f10-4a00-894c-3a3b886ad844.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1162/99608F92.8CD550D1?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1162/99608F92.8CD550D1, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1355.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, this field has only recently gained significant momentum because of the advances in technology and algorithms, along with new AI techniques such as machine learning methods for structured data, modern deep learning, and natural language processing for unstructured data. Although companies are eager to join the fray of this new AI trend and take advantage of its potential benefits, it is unclear what implications AI will have on society now and in the long term. Using the five dimensions of sustainability to structure the analysis, we explore the impacts of AI on several domains. We find that there is a significant impact on all five dimensions, with positive and negative impacts, and that value, collaboration, sharing responsibilities; ethics will play a vital role in any future sustainable development of AI in society. Our exploration provides a foundation for in-depth discussions and future research collaborations.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/6/4/100/pdf?version=1541240975", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/TECHNOLOGIES6040100?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/TECHNOLOGIES6040100, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Such a consensus is likely to emerge in many areas in which intelligent autonomous systems are apt to be deployed and for the actions they are liable to undertake, as we are more likely to agree on how machines ought to treat us than on how human beings ought to treat one another. Given such a consensus, particular cases of ethical dilemmas where ethicists agree on the ethically relevant features and the right course of action can be used to help discover principles needed for ethical guidance of the behavior of autonomous systems. Such principles help ensure the ethical behavior of complex and dynamic systems and further serve as a basis for justification of this behavior. To provide assistance in discovering ethical principles, we have developed GenEth, a general ethical dilemma analyzer that, through a dialog with ethicists, uses inductive logic programming to codify ethical principles in any given domain. GenEth has been used to codify principles in a number of domains pertinent to the behavior of autonomous systems and these principles have been verified using an Ethical Turing Test, a test devised to compare the judgments of codified principles with that of ethicists.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pjbr-2018-0024/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1515/pjbr-2018-0024?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1515/pjbr-2018-0024, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that generate content, such as text, audio, or video, aiming to produce novel and creative outputs based on training data. Compared to conversational artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence systems have the unique capability of not only providing replies but also generating the content of those responses. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, have gained popularity and reshaped content production and creation. However, the benefits of generative artificial intelligence are not equally accessible to all, especially in developing countries, where limited access to cutting-edge technologies and inadequate infrastructure pose challenges. This paper seeks to understand the potential impact of generative AI technologies on developing countries, considering economic growth, access to technology, and the potential paradigm shift in education, healthcare, and the environment. The findings emphasize the importance of providing the necessary support and infrastructure to ensure that generative AI contributes to inclusive development rather than deepening existing inequalities. The study highlights the significance of integrating Generative AI into the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in developing countries, where technological change is a crucial determinant of progress and equitable growth.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/02666669231200628?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/02666669231200628, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

What is Beyond Expectations?", "abstract": "Generative AI has the potential to change the way we do things. The chatbot is one of the most popular implementation areas. Even though companies like Google and Meta had chatbots, ChatGPT became popular as it was made publicly available. Although ChatGPT is still in the early stages of its development, it attracted the attention of people and capital groups. It has taken the public interest; people from different fields, ages, and education levels started using ChatGPT. There have been many trials with ChatGPT. It is possible to see a lot of news and shares on the Internet. The study aims to shed light on what is happening in the literature and get an insight into the user expectations of ChatGPT and Generative AI. We also give information about the competitors of ChatGPT, such as Google\u2019s Bard AI, Claude, Meta\u2019s Wit.ai and Tencent\u2019s HunyuanAide. We describe technical and structural fundamentals and try to shed light on who will win the race. We also shared information about the GPT4 version of OpenAI's ChatGPT. We share the early stage due diligence and current situation analysis for all these points. We examine preprint papers and published articles. We also included striking posts on the LinkedIn platform and a compilation of various blogs and news. We also made use of ChatGPT in editing the content of these resources of this study. We can get an insight into the people's interests through their questions submitted to ChatGPT. We can also understand the capabilities of GPT3, GPT4 and also predict further enhancements.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/3127764", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2139/ssrn.4341500?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4341500, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As genetic testing becomes more common practice in the clinical setting, the number of rare disease diagnoses will continue to increase, resulting in the need for novel treatment options. Identifying treatments for these disorders is challenging due to a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, small cohort sizes, interindividual symptom variability, and little commercial incentive to develop new treatments. A promising avenue for treatment is drug repurposing, where FDA-approved drugs are repositioned as novel treatments. However, linking disease mechanisms to drug action can be extraordinarily difficult and requires a depth of knowledge across multiple fields, which is complicated by the rapid pace of biomedical knowledge discovery. To address these challenges, The Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute developed an artificial intelligence tool, mediKanren, that leverages the mechanistic insight of genetic disorders to identify therapeutic options. Using knowledge graphs, mediKanren enables an efficient way to link all relevant literature and databases. This tool has allowed for a scalable process that has been used to help over 500 rare disease families. Here, we provide a description of our process, the advantages of mediKanren, and its impact on rare disease patients.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.910216/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9562701, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As learners construct their understanding about an ET and develop related skills by actually passing through the ET Innovation Process (IP) stages (Awareness, Acceptance and Adoption), it could be useful to provide them with training that imitates certain IP stages. Using Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Robotics (AIER) as the example ET, we designed a two-day workshop to lead learners (n = 16) through the AIER IP Awareness stage, and a six-week training course with eight contact days to simulate the AIER IP Acceptance stage to learners (n = 10). Using online surveys and quantitative content analysis methods we confirmed that the workshop format increased the AIER-related self-confidence and general knowledge in 78% of participants, while the training course helped more than half of the participants to construct usable knowledge about a specific AIER and to see its possibilities in their specific work-place contexts. This paper is the pilot of using the Technology-Enhanced Learning Innovation Process (TELIP) model, first tested on a STEAM innovation, outside the educational context, for developing appropriate training approaches for specific ET IP stages.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/22/2876/pdf?version=1637754190", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/math9222876?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/math9222876, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Data centers require a tremendous amount of energy to operate, accounting for around 1.8% of electricity use in the United States. Large amounts of water are also required to operate data centers, both directly for liquid cooling and indirectly to produce electricity. For the first time, we calculate spatially-detailed carbon and water footprints of data centers operating within the United States, which is home to around one-quarter of all data center servers globally. Our bottom-up approach reveals one-fifth of data center servers direct water footprint comes from moderately to highly water stressed watersheds, while nearly half of servers are fully or partially powered by power plants located within water stressed regions. Approximately 0.5% of total US greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to data centers. We investigate tradeoffs and synergies between data center\u2019s water and energy utilization by strategically locating data centers in areas of the country that will minimize one or more environmental footprints.

Therefore, this study sought to investigate the influence of artificial intelligence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. Using content analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong influence on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the certainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development possible in emerging economies. The results revealed that Artificial intelligence is making poverty reduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps, revolutionizing agriculture education and the finance sector through financial inclusion. The study also discovered that AI is also assisting a lot in education, and the financial sector allowing the previously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy.

To reliably support the online services used by these billions of users, data centres have been built around the world to provide the millions of servers they contain with access to power, cooling and internet connectivity. Whilst the energy consumption of these facilities regularly receives mainstream and academic coverage, analysis of their water consumption is scarce. Data centres consume water directly for cooling, in some cases 57% sourced from potable water, and indirectly through the water requirements of non-renewable electricity generation. Although in the USA, data centre water consumption (1.7 billion litres/day) is small compared to total water consumption (1218 billion litres/day), there are issues of transparency with less than a third of data centre operators measuring water consumption.

This framework maps 59 generic tasks from worker surveys and an occupational database to 14 cognitive abilities (that we extract from the cognitive science literature) and these to a comprehensive list of 328 AI benchmarks used to evaluate research intensity across a broad range of different AI areas. The use of cognitive abilities as an intermediate layer, instead of mapping work tasks to AI benchmarks directly, allows for an identification of potential AI exposure for tasks for which AI applications have not been explicitly created. An application of our framework to occupational databases gives insights into the abilities through which AI is most likely to affect jobs and allows for a ranking of occupations with respect to AI exposure. Moreover, we show that some jobs that were not known to be affected by previous waves of automation may now be subject to higher AI exposure. Finally, we find that some of the abilities where AI research is currently very intense are linked to tasks with comparatively limited labour input in the labour markets of advanced economies (e.g., visual and auditory processing using deep learning, and sensorimotor interaction through (deep) reinforcement learning). \nThis article appears in the special track on AI and Society.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/download/12647/26688", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1613/jair.1.12647?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.12647, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite increased awareness, the delay to diagnosis remains unchanged. This study explores whether a predictive model based on healthcare resource utilisation can be used to screen large populations to identify patients at high risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service in England, providing close to full national coverage, were used as a measure of healthcare resource utilisation. Data for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension from the National Pulmonary Hypertension Service in Sheffield were linked to pre-diagnosis Hospital Episode Statistics records. A non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension control cohort was selected from the Hospital Episode Statistics population. Patient history was limited to \u22645 years pre-diagnosis. Information on demographics, timing/frequency of diagnoses, medical specialities visited and procedures undertaken was captured. For modelling, a bagged gradient boosting trees algorithm was used to discriminate between cohorts. Between 2008 and 2016, 709 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were identified and compared with a stratified cohort of 2,812,458 patients classified as non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with \u22651 ICD-10 coded diagnosis of relevance to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. A predictive model was developed and validated using cross-validation. The timing and frequency of the clinical speciality seen, secondary diagnoses and age were key variables driving the algorithm\u2019s performance. To identify the 100 patients at highest risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, 969 patients would need to be screened with a specificity of 99.99% and sensitivity of 14.10% based on a prevalence of 5.5/million. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 10.32% and 99.99%, respectively. This study highlights the potential application of artificial intelligence to readily available real-world data to screen for rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This algorithm could provide low-cost screening at a population level, facilitating earlier diagnosis, improved diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. Studies to further validate this approach are warranted.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2045894019890549", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1177/2045894019890549?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1177/2045894019890549, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Back in 1858, for example, the UK parliament was dealing with another messy crisis: \u201cthe great stink.\u201d In a world before sanitation, the river Thames had become an open latrine, and as summer blossomed parliament was engulfed in a pestilential stench. \u00a32.5 million (about \u00a3300 million in today\u2019s money) was hastily approved to build a network of sewers throughout the capital. This particular model of sanitation, developed by Bazalgette, was adopted by other cities around the world and the rest, as they say, is history. It is now unthinkable that a developed nation would not have sanitation infrastructure. However, back in 1858 the debate was whether sanitation infrastructure was worthy of investment and whether it was a public or private good. A similar debate has been simmering for some time regarding health data infrastructure, defined as the hardware and software to securely aggregate, store, process and transmit healthcare data. Is data infrastructure necessary for healthcare organizations and if so, is it the responsibility of individual healthcare organizations, of local health systems, or is it a public good? In the 21st Century, the age of big data and artificial intelligence (AI), each healthcare organization has built its own data infrastructure to support its own needs, typically involving onpremises computing and storage. Data is balkanized along organizational boundaries, severely constraining the ability to provide services to patients across a care continuum within one organization or across organizations. This situation evolved as individual organizations had to buy and maintain the costly hardware and software required for healthcare, and has been reinforced by vendor lock-in, most notably in electronic medical records (EMRs). With increasing cost pressure and policy imperatives to manage patients across and between care episodes, the need to aggregate data across and between departments within a healthcare organization and across disparate organizations has become apparent not only to realize the promise of AI but also to improve the efficiency of existing data intensive tasks such as any population level segmentation and patient safety monitoring. The rapid explosion in AI has introduced the possibility of using aggregated healthcare data to produce powerful models that can automate diagnosis and also enable an increasingly precision approach to medicine by tailoring treatments and targeting resources with maximum effectiveness in a timely and dynamic manner. However, \u201cthe inconvenient truth\u201d is that at present the algorithms that feature prominently in research literature are in fact not, for the most part, executable at the frontlines of clinical practice. This is for two reasons: first, these AI innovations by themselves do not re-engineer the incentives that support existing ways of working. A complex web of ingrained political and economic factors as well as the proximal influence of medical practice norms and commercial interests determine the way healthcare is delivered. Simply adding AI applications to a fragmented system will not create sustainable change. Second, most healthcare organizations lack the data infrastructure required to collect the data needed to optimally train algorithms to (a) \u201cfit\u201d the local population and/or the local practice patterns, a requirement prior to deployment that is rarely highlighted by current AI publications, and (b) interrogate them for bias to guarantee that the algorithms perform consistently across patient cohorts, especially those who may not have been adequately represented in the training cohort. For example, an algorithm trained on mostly Caucasian patients is not expected to have the same accuracy when applied to minorities. In addition, such rigorous evaluation and re-calibration must continue after implementation to track and capture those patient demographics and practice patterns which inevitably change over time. Some of these issues can be addressed through external validation, the importance of which is not unique to AI, and it is timely that existing standards for prediction model reporting are being updated specifically to incorporate standards applicable to this end. In the United States, there are islands of aggregated healthcare data in the ICU, and in the Veterans Administration. These aggregated data sets have predictably catalyzed an acceleration in AI development; but without broader development of data infrastructure outside these islands it will not be possible to generalize these innovations. Elsewhere in the economy, the development of cloud computing, secure high-performance general use data infrastructure and services available via the Internet (the \u201ccloud\u201d), has been a significant enabler for large and small technology companies alike, providing significantly lower fixed costs and higher performance as well as supporting the aforementioned opportunities for AI. Healthcare, with its abundance of data, is in theory well-poised to benefit from growth in cloud computing. The largest and arguably most valuable store of data in healthcare rests in EMRs. However, clinician satisfaction with EMRs remains low, resulting in variable completeness and quality of data entry, and interoperability between different providers remains elusive. The typical lament of a harried clinician is still \u201cwhy does my EMR still suck and why don\u2019t all these systems just talk to each other?\u201d Policy imperatives have attempted to address these dilemmas, however progress has been minimal.

It is bringing a paradigm shift to healthcare, powered by increasing availability of healthcare data and rapid progress of analytics techniques. We survey the current status of AI applications in healthcare and discuss its future. AI can be applied to various types of healthcare data (structured and unstructured). Popular AI techniques include machine learning methods for structured data, such as the classical support vector machine and neural network, and the modern deep learning, as well as natural language processing for unstructured data. Major disease areas that use AI tools include cancer, neurology and cardiology. We then review in more details the AI applications in stroke, in the three major areas of early detection and diagnosis, treatment, as well as outcome prediction and prognosis evaluation. We conclude with discussion about pioneer AI systems, such as IBM Watson, and hurdles for real-life deployment of AI.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://svn.bmj.com/content/svnbmj/2/4/230.full.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5829945, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Medical ethics remains one-sided, however. It tends (incorrectly) to interpret patient autonomy as mere participation in decisions, rather than a willingness to take the consequences. In this respect, medical ethics remains largely paternalistic, requiring doctors to protect patients from the consequences of their decisions. This is reflected in a one-sided account of duties in medical ethics. Medical ethics may exempt patients from obligations because they are the weaker or more vulnerable party in the doctor-patient relationship. We argue that vulnerability does not exclude obligation. We also look at others ways in which patients\u2019 responsibilities flow from general ethics: for instance, from responsibilities to others and to the self, from duties of citizens, and from the responsibilities of those who solicit advice. Finally, we argue that certain duties of patients counterbalance an otherwise unfair captivity of doctors as helpers.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.17265/2159-5313/2016.09.003", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.17265/2159-5313/2016.09.003?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.17265/2159-5313/2016.09.003, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Low Power Consumption Embedded Devices (LPCED), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks, make it possible to work over great distances at a reduced cost but with limited transferable data volumes. However, data management (DM) in intelligent agriculture is still not well understood due to the fact that there are not enough scientific publications available on this. Though data management (DM) benefits are factual and substantial, many challenges must be addressed in order to fully realize the DM\u2019s potential. The main difficulties are data integration complexities, the lack of skilled personnel and sufficient resources, inadequate infrastructure, and insignificant data warehouse architecture. This work proposes a comprehensive architecture that includes big data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based systems. We proposed an AI-based architecture for smart farming. This architecture called, Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture (SFOBA), is designed to guarantee the system\u2019s durability and the data modeling in order to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics. Furthermore, the proposed solution is built on a pre-defined big data architecture that includes an abstraction layer of the data lake that handles data quality, following a data migration strategy in order to ensure the data\u2019s insights.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/3/329/pdf?version=1645707921", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/agriculture12030329?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12030329, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The primary issues in agricultural production include decision-making, crop selection, and supporting systems for crop yield enhancement. Agriculture forecasting is influenced by natural variables such as temperature, soil fertility, water volume, water quality, season, and crop prices. Growing advancements in agricultural automation have resulted in a flood of tools and apps for rapid knowledge acquisition. Mobile devices are rapidly being used by everyone, including farmers. This paper presents a framework for smart crop tracking and monitoring. Sensors, Internet of Things cameras, mobile applications, and big data analytics are all covered.

However, climate change has begun to affect crop yields badly. Consequently, farmers are unable to choose the right crop/s based on soil and environmental factors, and the process of manually predicting the choice of the right crop/s of land has, more often than not, resulted in failure. Accurate crop prediction results in increased crop production. This is where machine learning playing a crucial role in the area of crop prediction. Crop prediction depends on the soil, geographic and climatic attributes. Selecting appropriate attributes for the right crop/s is an intrinsic part of the prediction undertaken by feature selection techniques. In this work, a comparative study of various wrapper feature selection methods are carried out for crop prediction using classification techniques that suggest the suitable crop/s for land. The experimental results show the Recursive Feature Elimination technique with the Adaptive Bagging classifier outperforms the others.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13873954.2021.1882505", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/13873954.2021.1882505?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/13873954.2021.1882505, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In fact it is been keeping up with food production at a very high rate. In fact, some scientists feel that agriculture already produces enough food to feed the world, but of course there are issues and problems with food availability, agricultural production practices, preservation and transportation, and probably more that one can think of that hinder many people in this world from getting adequate food. The basic challenge is to provide food for the needy people. This need can be fulfilled with the help of the farmers taking responsibility in increasing the food production by 50% by the year 2050. The objective of the present work is to increase this food production, protecting the environmentwith managing natural resources. Mainly focusing on water, nutrients and other inputs to produce foods without degrading the environment. The Goal is to develop the social, environmental, and the economic aspects of possible solutions to minimize the agricultural footprint, and become more sustainable. The dataset considered in our experiment is used in yield prediction based on historic yield and weather information. Implemented both the versions of Thomson model and compared the result with segmentation model, Random Forest (RF). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used as evaluation metrics in estimating the performance of models implements and stated that Random forest algorithm is providing 0.07 (RMSE).

The full potential of these precision agriculture technologies may be exploited in combination with innovative methods of data processing such as machine learning (ML) algorithms for the extraction of useful information responsible for controlling crop yield. Four ML algorithms, namely linear regression (LR), elastic net (EN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector regression (SVR), were used to predict potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yield from data of soil and crop properties collected through proximal sensing. Six fields in Atlantic Canada including three fields in Prince Edward Island (PE) and three fields in New Brunswick (NB) were sampled, over two (2017 and 2018) growing seasons, for soil electrical conductivity, soil moisture content, soil slope, normalized-difference vegetative index (NDVI), and soil chemistry. Data were collected from 39\u201340 30 \u00d7 30 m2 locations in each field, four times throughout the growing season, and yield samples were collected manually at the end of the growing season. Four datasets, namely PE-2017, PE-2018, NB-2017, and NB-2018, were then formed by combing data points from three fields to represent the province data for the respective years. Modeling techniques were employed to generate yield predictions assessed with different statistical parameters. The SVR models outperformed all other models for NB-2017, NB-2018, PE-2017, and PE-2018 dataset with RMSE of 5.97, 4.62, 6.60, and 6.17 t/ha, respectively. The performance of k-NN remained poor in three out of four datasets, namely NB-2017, NB-2018, and PE-2017 with RMSE of 6.93, 5.23, and 6.91 t/ha, respectively. The study also showed that large datasets are required to generate useful results using either model.

However, RBFs have not been integrated into contemporary deep learning research and computer vision using conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their lack of adaptability with modern architectures. In this paper, we adapt RBF networks as a classifier on top of CNNs by modifying the training process and introducing a new activation function to train modern vision architectures end-to-end for image classification. The specific architecture of RBFs enables the learning of a similarity distance metric to compare and find similar and dissimilar images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an RBF classifier on top of any CNN architecture provides new human-interpretable insights about the decision-making process of the models. Finally, we successfully apply RBFs to a range of CNN architectures and evaluate the results on benchmark computer vision datasets.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09133368.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11401, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Unlike other crops, it is a typical root crop with a special growth cycle pattern and underground tubers, which makes it harder to track the progress of potatoes and to provide automated crop management. The classification of growth stages has great significance for right time management in the potato field. This paper aims to study how to classify the growth stage of potato crops accurately on the basis of spectroscopy technology. To develop a classification model that monitors the growth stage of potato crops, the field experiments were conducted at the tillering stage (S1), tuber formation stage (S2), tuber bulking stage (S3), and tuber maturation stage (S4), respectively. After spectral data pre-processing, the dynamic changes in chlorophyll content and spectral response during growth were analyzed. A classification model was then established using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm based on spectral bands and the wavelet coefficients obtained from the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of reflectance spectra. The spectral variables, which include sensitive spectral bands and feature wavelet coefficients, were optimized using three selection algorithms to improve the classification performance of the model. The selection algorithms include correlation analysis (CA), the successive projection algorithm (SPA), and the random frog (RF) algorithm. The model results were used to compare the performance of various methods. The CWT-SPA-SVM model exhibited excellent performance. The classification accuracies on the training set (Atrain) and the test set (Atest) were respectively 100% and 97.37%, demonstrating the good classification capability of the model. The difference between the Atrain and accuracy of cross-validation (Acv) was 1%, which showed that the model has good stability. Therefore, the CWT-SPA-SVM model can be used to classify the growth stages of potato crops accurately. This study provides an important support method for the classification of growth stages in the potato field.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/14/3995/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7411602, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, traditional yield assessment approaches are laborious and time-consuming, and thus hinder the acquisition of timely information at the field scale. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention in precision agriculture due to their efficiency in data acquisition. In addition, compared with other imaging modalities, hyperspectral data can offer higher spectral fidelity for constructing narrow-band vegetation indices which are of great importance in yield modeling. In this study, we performed an in-season alfalfa yield prediction using UAV-based hyperspectral images. Specifically, we firstly extracted a large number of hyperspectral indices from the original data and performed a feature selection to reduce the data dimensionality. Then, an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining three widely used base learners including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The model performance was evaluated on experimental fields in Wisconsin. Our results showed that the ensemble model outperformed all the base learners and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.874 was achieved when using the selected features. In addition, we also evaluated the model adaptability on different machinery compaction treatments, and the results further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/12/2028/pdf?version=1593358319", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs12122028?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12122028, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, these benefits are often reduced when cover crops are infested by Cynodon dactylon (bermudagrass), which impacts crop production due to its competition for water and nutrients and causes important economic losses for the winegrowers. Therefore, the discrimination of Cynodon dactylon in cover crops would enable site-specific control to be applied and thus drastically mitigate damage to the vineyard. In this context, this research proposes a novel, automatic and robust image analysis algorithm for the quick and accurate mapping of Cynodon dactylon growing in vineyard cover crops. The algorithm was developed using aerial images taken with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and combined decision tree (DT) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) approaches. The relevance of this work consisted in dealing with the constraint caused by the spectral similarity of these complex scenarios formed by vines, cover crops, Cynodon dactylon, and bare soil. The incorporation of height information from the Digital Surface Model and several features selected by machine learning tools in the DT-OBIA algorithm solved this spectral similarity limitation and allowed the precise design of Cynodon dactylon maps. Another contribution of this work is the short time needed to apply the full process from UAV flights to image analysis, which can enable useful maps to be created on demand (within two days of the farmer\u00b4s request) and is thus timely for controlling Cynodon dactylon in the herbicide application window. Therefore, this combination of UAV imagery and a DT-OBIA algorithm would allow winegrowers to apply site-specific control of Cynodon dactylon and maintain cover crop-based management systems and their consequent benefits in the vineyards, and also comply with the European legal framework for the sustainable use of agricultural inputs and implementation of integrated crop management.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/1/56/pdf?version=1578045380", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs12010056?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12010056, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There is a need for robust, automatic and consistent early detection and quantification of disease symptoms which are important in breeding programs for the development of improved cultivars and in crop production for the implementation of disease control measures for yield protection. Current methods of plant disease phenotyping are predominantly visual and hence are slow and prone to human error and variation. There has been increasing interest in hyperspectral imaging applications for early detection of disease symptoms. However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data makes it very important to have an efficient analysis pipeline in place for the identification of disease so that effective crop management decisions can be made. The focus of this work is to determine the minimal number of most effective hyperspectral wavebands that can distinguish between healthy and diseased soybean stem specimens early on in the growing season for proper management of the disease. 111 hyperspectral data cubes representing healthy and infected stems were captured at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after inoculation. We utilized inoculated and control specimens from 4 different genotypes. Each hyperspectral image was captured at 240 different wavelengths in the range of 383\u20131032 nm. We formulated the identification of best waveband combination from 240 wavebands as an optimization problem. We used a combination of genetic algorithm as an optimizer and support vector machines as a classifier for the identification of maximally-effective waveband combination. A binary classification between healthy and infected soybean stem samples using the selected six waveband combination (475.56, 548.91, 652.14, 516.31, 720.05, 915.64 nm) obtained a classification accuracy of 97% for the infected class. Furthermore, we achieved a classification accuracy of 90.91% for test samples from 3 days after inoculation using the selected six waveband combination. The results demonstrated that these carefully-chosen wavebands are more informative than RGB images alone and enable early identification of charcoal rot infection in soybean. The selected wavebands could be used in a multispectral camera for remote identification of charcoal rot infection in soybean.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13007-018-0349-9", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6169113, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Real data of an irrigation zone of Mexico were\nused for building the models. Models were tested with samples of two consecutive years. The results show that M5-\nPrime and k-nearest neighbor techniques obtain the lowest average RMSE errors (5.14 and 4.91), the lowest RRSE\nerrors (79.46% and 79.78%), the lowest average MAE errors (18.12% and 19.42%), and the highest average correlation\nfactors (0.41 and 0.42).

Crop mapping and time series analysis of agronomic cycles are critical for monitoring land use and land management practices, and analysing the issues of agro-environmental impacts and climate change. Multi-temporal Landsat data can be used to analyse decadal changes in cropping patterns at field level, owing to its medium spatial resolution and historical availability. This study attempts to develop robust remote sensing techniques, applicable across a large geographic extent, for state-wide mapping of cropping history in Queensland, Australia. In this context, traditional pixel-based classification was analysed in comparison with image object-based classification using advanced supervised machine-learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). For the Darling Downs region of southern Queensland we gathered a set of Landsat TM images from the 2010\u20132011 cropping season. Landsat data, along with the vegetation index images, were subjected to multiresolution segmentation to obtain polygon objects. Object-based methods enabled the analysis of aggregated sets of pixels, and exploited shape-related and textural variation, as well as spectral characteristics. SVM models were chosen after examining three shape-based parameters, twenty-three textural parameters and ten spectral parameters of the objects. We found that the object-based methods were superior to the pixel-based methods for classifying 4 major landuse/land cover classes, considering the complexities of within field spectral heterogeneity and spectral mixing. Comparative analysis clearly revealed that higher overall classification accuracy (95%) was observed in the object-based SVM compared with that of traditional pixel-based classification (89%) using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Object-based classification also resulted speckle-free images. Further, object-based SVM models were used to classify different broadacre crop types for summer and winter seasons. The influence of different shape, textural and spectral variables, and their weights on crop-mapping accuracy, was also examined. Temporal change in the spectral characteristics, specifically through vegetation indices derived from multi-temporal Landsat data, was found to be the most critical information that affects the accuracy of classification. However, use of these variables was constrained by the data availability and cloud cover.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b7-185-2012", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/ISPRSARCHIVES-XXXIX-B7-185-2012?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/ISPRSARCHIVES-XXXIX-B7-185-2012, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of hyperspectral data in detecting the early stage of PLS in tropical maize. Field data were collected from healthy and the early stage of PLS over two years (2013 and 2014) using a handheld spectroradiometer. An integration of a newly developed guided regularized random forest (GRRF) and a traditional random forest (RF) was used for feature selection and classification, respectively. The 2013 dataset was used to train the model, while the 2014 dataset was used as independent test dataset. Results showed that there were statistically significant differences in biochemical concentration between the healthy leaves and leaves that were at an early stage of PLS infestation. The newly developed GRRF was able to reduce the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data by selecting key wavelengths with less autocorrelation. These wavelengths are located at 420 nm, 795 nm, 779 nm, 1543 nm, 1747 nm, and 1010 nm. Using these variables (), a random forest classifier was able to discriminate between the healthy maize and maize at an early stage of PLS infestation with an overall accuracy of 88% and a kappa value of 0.75. Overall, our study showed potential application of hyperspectral data, GRRF feature selection, and RF classifiers in detecting the early stage of PLS infestation in tropical maize.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jspec/2017/6961387.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2017/6961387?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6961387, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the assessment of medical images has led to accurate evaluations being performed automatically, which in turn has reduced the workload of physicians, decreased errors and times in diagnosis, and improved performance in the prediction and detection of various diseases. AI techniques based on medical image processing are an essential area of research that uses advanced computer algorithms for prediction, diagnosis, and treatment planning, leading to a remarkable impact on decision-making procedures. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) as advanced AI techniques are two main subfields applied in the healthcare system to diagnose diseases, discover medication, and identify patient risk factors. The advancement of electronic medical records and big data technologies in recent years has accompanied the success of ML and DL algorithms. ML includes neural networks and fuzzy logic algorithms with various applications in automating forecasting and diagnosis processes. DL algorithm is an ML technique that does not rely on expert feature extraction, unlike classical neural network algorithms. DL algorithms with high-performance calculations give promising results in medical image analysis, such as fusion, segmentation, recording, and classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) as an ML method and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a DL method is usually the most widely used techniques for analyzing and diagnosing diseases. This review study aims to cover recent AI techniques in diagnosing and predicting numerous diseases such as cancers, heart, lung, skin, genetic, and neural disorders, which perform more precisely compared to specialists without human error. Also, AI's existing challenges and limitations in the medical area are discussed and highlighted.", "year": 2023, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44163-023-00049-5.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9885935, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

These adverse effects are also seen as ethical issues and affect trustworthiness in medical AI and need to be managed through identification, prognosis and monitoring. Methods We adopted a multidisciplinary approach and summarized five subjects that influence the trustworthiness of medical AI: data quality, algorithmic bias, opacity, safety and security, and responsibility attribution, and discussed these factors from the perspectives of technology, law, and healthcare stakeholders and institutions. The ethical framework of ethical values-ethical principles-ethical norms is used to propose corresponding ethical governance countermeasures for trustworthy medical AI from the ethical, legal, and regulatory aspects. Results Medical data are primarily unstructured, lacking uniform and standardized annotation, and data quality will directly affect the quality of medical AI algorithm models. Algorithmic bias can affect AI clinical predictions and exacerbate health disparities. The opacity of algorithms affects patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 trust in medical AI, and algorithmic errors or security vulnerabilities can pose significant risks and harm to patients. The involvement of medical AI in clinical practices may threaten doctors \u2018and patients\u2019 autonomy and dignity. When accidents occur with medical AI, the responsibility attribution is not clear. All these factors affect people\u2019s trust in medical AI. Conclusions In order to make medical AI trustworthy, at the ethical level, the ethical value orientation of promoting human health should first and foremost be considered as the top-level design. At the legal level, current medical AI does not have moral status and humans remain the duty bearers. At the regulatory level, strengthening data quality management, improving algorithm transparency and traceability to reduce algorithm bias, and regulating and reviewing the whole process of the AI industry to control risks are proposed. It is also necessary to encourage multiple parties to discuss and assess AI risks and social impacts, and to strengthen international cooperation and communication.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12911-023-02103-9", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9840286, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In research, datasets, metrics, techniques, and tools are applied to detect and mitigate algorithmic unfairness and bias. This study examines the current knowledge on bias and unfairness in machine learning models. The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and is registered on OSF plataform. The search was carried out between 2021 and early 2022 in the Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Google Scholar knowledge bases and found 128 articles published between 2017 and 2022, of which 45 were chosen based on search string optimization and inclusion and exclusion criteria. We discovered that the majority of retrieved works focus on bias and unfairness identification and mitigation techniques, offering tools, statistical approaches, important metrics, and datasets typically used for bias experiments. In terms of the primary forms of bias, data, algorithm, and user interaction were addressed in connection to the preprocessing, in-processing, and postprocessing mitigation methods. The use of Equalized Odds, Opportunity Equality, and Demographic Parity as primary fairness metrics emphasizes the crucial role of sensitive attributes in mitigating bias. The 25 datasets chosen span a wide range of areas, including criminal justice image enhancement, finance, education, product pricing, and health, with the majority including sensitive attributes. In terms of tools, Aequitas is the most often referenced, yet many of the tools were not employed in empirical experiments. A limitation of current research is the lack of multiclass and multimetric studies, which are found in just a few works and constrain the investigation to binary-focused method. Furthermore, the results indicate that different fairness metrics do not present uniform results for a given use case, and that more research with varied model architectures is necessary to standardize which ones are more appropriate for a given context. We also observed that all research addressed the transparency of the algorithm, or its capacity to explain how decisions are taken.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/7/1/15/pdf?version=1674136071", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/bdcc7010015?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc7010015, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

EHR and EMR are collected from patients to record their basic information, lab tests, vital signs, clinical notes, and reports. EHR and EMR contain the helpful information to assist oncologists in computer-aided diagnosis and decision making. However, it is time consuming for doctors to extract the valuable information they need and analyze the information from the EHR and EMR data. Recently, more and more research works have applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, i.e., rule-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based techniques, on the EHR and EMR data for computer-aided diagnosis in oncology. The objective of this review is to narratively review the recent progress in the area of NLP applications for computer-aided diagnosis in oncology. Moreover, we intend to reduce the research gap between artificial intelligence (AI) experts and clinical specialists to design better NLP applications. We originally identified 295 articles from the three electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and ACL Anthology; then, we removed the duplicated papers and manually screened the irrelevant papers based on the content of the abstract; finally, we included a total of 23 articles after the screening process of the literature review. Furthermore, we provided an in-depth analysis and categorized these studies into seven cancer types: breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and brain tumors. Additionally, we identified the current limitations of NLP applications on supporting the clinical practices and we suggest some promising future research directions in this paper.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/2/286/pdf?version=1673516485", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9857980, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Common clinical tools and machine-learning (ML) models for screening osteoporosis have been developed, but they show limitations such as low accuracy. Moreover, these methods are confined to limited risk factors and lack individualized explanation. Objective The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable deep-learning (DL) model for osteoporosis risk screening with clinical features. Clinical interpretation with individual explanations of feature contributions is provided using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. Methods We used two separate data sets: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data sets from the United States (NHANES) and South Korea (KNHANES) with 8274 and 8680 respondents, respectively. The study population was classified according to the T-score of bone mineral density at the femoral neck or total femur. A DL model for osteoporosis diagnosis was trained on the data sets and significant risk factors were investigated with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The performance of the DL model was compared with that of ML models and conventional clinical tools. Additionally, contribution ranking of risk factors and individualized explanation of feature contribution were examined. Results Our DL model showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.851 (95% CI 0.844-0.858) and 0.922 (95% CI 0.916-0.928) for the femoral neck and total femur bone mineral density, respectively, using the NHANES data set. The corresponding AUC values for the KNHANES data set were 0.827 (95% CI 0.821-0.833) and 0.912 (95% CI 0.898-0.927), respectively. Through the LIME method, significant features were induced, and each feature\u2019s integrated contribution and interpretation for individual risk were determined. Conclusions The developed DL model significantly outperforms conventional ML models and clinical tools. Our XAI model produces high-ranked features along with the integrated contributions of each feature, which facilitates the interpretation of individual risk. In summary, our interpretable model for osteoporosis risk screening outperformed state-of-the-art methods.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e40179/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9883743, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One of the significant contributors to the success of DL is the proliferation of end devices that act as a catalyst to provide data for data-hungry DL models. However, computing DL training and inference still remains the biggest challenge. Moreover, most of the time central cloud servers are used for such computation, thus opening up other significant challenges, such as high latency, increased communication costs, and privacy concerns. To mitigate these drawbacks, considerable efforts have been made to push the processing of DL models to edge servers (a mesh of computing devices near end devices). Recently, the confluence point of DL and edge has given rise to edge intelligence (EI), defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as the concept where the data is acquired, stored, and processed utilizing edge computing with DL and advanced networking capabilities. Broadly, EI has six levels of categories based on the three locations where the training and inference of DL take place, e.g., cloud server, edge server, and end devices. This survey paper focuses primarily on the fifth level of EI, called all in-edge level, where DL training and inference (deployment) are performed solely by edge servers. All in-edge is suitable when the end devices have low computing resources, e.g., Internet-of-Things, and other requirements such as latency and communication cost are important such as in mission-critical applications (e.g., health care). Besides, 5G/6G networks are envisioned to use all in-edge. Firstly, this paper presents all in-edge computing architectures, including centralized, decentralized, and distributed. Secondly, this paper presents enabling technologies, such as model parallelism, data parallelism, and split learning, which facilitates DL training and deployment at edge servers. Thirdly, model adaptation techniques based on model compression and conditional computation are described because the standard cloud-based DL deployment cannot be directly applied to all in-edge due to its limited computational resources. Fourthly, this paper discusses eleven key performance metrics to evaluate the performance of DL at all in-edge efficiently. Finally, several open research challenges in the area of all in-edge are presented.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/10005208/10007810.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03326, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite the recent success of deep learning-based cell segmentation methods, it remains challenging to accurately segment densely packed cells in 3D cell membrane images. Existing approaches also require fine-tuning multiple manually selected hyperparameters on the new datasets. We develop a deep learning-based 3D cell segmentation pipeline, 3DCellSeg, to address these challenges. Compared to the existing methods, our approach carries the following novelties: (1) a robust two-stage pipeline, requiring only one hyperparameter; (2) a light-weight deep convolutional neural network (3DCellSegNet) to efficiently output voxel-wise masks; (3) a custom loss function (3DCellSeg Loss) to tackle the clumped cell problem; and (4) an efficient touching area-based clustering algorithm (TASCAN) to separate 3D cells from the foreground masks. Cell segmentation experiments conducted on four different cell datasets show that 3DCellSeg outperforms the baseline models on the ATAS (plant), HMS (animal), and LRP (plant) datasets with an overall accuracy of 95.6%, 76.4%, and 74.7%, respectively, while achieving an accuracy comparable to the baselines on the Ovules (plant) dataset with an overall accuracy of 82.2%. Ablation studies show that the individual improvements in accuracy is attributable to 3DCellSegNet, 3DCellSeg Loss, and TASCAN, with the 3DCellSeg demonstrating robustness across different datasets and cell shapes. Our results suggest that 3DCellSeg can serve a powerful biomedical and clinical tool, such as histo-pathological image analysis, for cancer diagnosis and grading.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04048-3.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8748745, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A key element for this purpose is the digitalization of the healthcare system through the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Nevertheless, there are major problems in the cloud with the IoT due to false predictions and errors in medical data, which results in taking a longer time to receive patient details and not providing the best outcome. Data transfer through the cloud can also be hacked by attackers due to the lack of security. This leads to a challenge for medical experts to predict the diseases accurately for a specific patient. Therefore, a novel hybrid elapid encryption (HEE) method was proposed for improving the security of cloud systems.

In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector. This research will be a baseline study for understanding the role of the IoT in smart cities, in particular in the healthcare sector, for future research works.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/13/8/218/pdf?version=1629696512", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/fi13080218?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/fi13080218, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Within several years after the emergence of AlexNet, the performance of deep neural networks has already surpassed human being experts in certain areas and showed great potential in applications such as medical image analysis. The development of automated breast cancer detection systems that integrate deep learning has received wide attention from the community. Breast cancer, a major killer of females that results in millions of deaths, can be controlled even be cured given that it is detected at an early stage with sophisticated systems. In this paper, we reviewed breast cancer diagnosis, detection, and segmentation computer\u2010aided (CAD) systems based on state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art deep convolutional neural networks. The available data sets also indirectly determine CAD systems' performance, so we introduced and discussed the details of public data sets. The challenges remaining in CAD systems for breast cancer are discussed at the end of this paper. The highlights of this survey mainly come from three following aspects. First, we covered a wide range of the basics of breast cancer from imaging modalities to popular databases in the community; Second, we presented the key elements in deep learning to form the compactness for methods mentioned in reviewed papers; Third and lastly, the summative details in each reviewed paper are provided so that interested readers can have a refined version of these works without referring to original papers.

The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT developments in healthcare system, where a patient can be monitored using a collection of tiny-powered and lightweight wireless sensor nodes. However, the development of this new technology in healthcare applications without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. In this paper, at first, we highlight the major security requirements in BSN-based modern healthcare system. Subsequently, we propose a secure IoT-based healthcare system using BSN, called BSN-Care, which can efficiently accomplish those requirements. The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the most imperative technologies used in IoT-based modern healthcare system. It is basically a collection of low-power and lightweight wireless sensor nodes that are used to monitor the human body functions and surrounding environment. Since BSN nodes are used to collect sensitive (life-critical) information and may operate in hostile environments, accordingly, they require strict security mechanisms to prevent malicious interaction with the system.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://engrxiv.org/preprint/download/1801/3662", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31224/osf.io/38mbg?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31224/osf.io/38mbg, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With the advent of time, newer and newer brain diseases are being discovered. Thus, because of the variability of brain diseases, existing diagnosis or detection systems are becoming challenging and are still an open problem for research. Detection of brain diseases at an early stage can make a huge difference in attempting to cure them. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is surging through all spheres of science, and no doubt, it is revolutionizing the field of neurology. Application of AI in medical science has made brain disease prediction and detection more accurate and precise. In this study, we present a review on recent machine learning and deep learning approaches in detecting four brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), brain tumor, epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. 147 recent articles on four brain diseases are reviewed considering diverse machine learning and deep learning approaches, modalities, datasets etc. Twenty-two datasets are discussed which are used most frequently in the reviewed articles as a primary source of brain disease data. Moreover, a brief overview of different feature extraction techniques that are used in diagnosing brain diseases is provided. Finally, key findings from the reviewed articles are summarized and a number of major issues related to machine learning/deep learning-based brain disease diagnostic approaches are discussed.

The benefit of this approach is dependent on the ability of patients to access engaging high-quality information, but significant variability in the quality of web-based information often forces patients to navigate large quantities of inaccurate, incomplete, irrelevant, or inaccessible content. Personalization positions the patient at the center of health care models by considering their needs, preferences, goals, and values. However, the traditional methods used thus far in health care to determine the factors of high-quality content for a particular user are insufficient. Machine learning (ML) uses algorithms to process and uncover patterns within large volumes of data to develop predictive models that automatically improve over time. The health care sector has lagged behind other industries in implementing ML to analyze user and content features, which can automate personalized content recommendations on a mass scale. With the advent of big data in health care, which builds comprehensive patient profiles drawn from several disparate sources, ML can be used to integrate structured and unstructured data from users and content to deliver content that is predicted to be effective and engaging for patients. This enables patients to engage in their health and support education, self-management, and positive behavior change as well as to enhance clinical outcomes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2021/10/e25497/PDF", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8564651, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD), thanks to the brand new developed innovations of artificial intelligence, and especially deep-learning techniques, leads to a promising solution to human biases in performance by guarantying decision support during colonoscopy. The application of CAD on real-time colonoscopy helps increasing the adenoma detection rate, and therefore contributes to reduce the incidence of interval cancers improving the effectiveness of colonoscopy screening on critical outcome such as colorectal cancer related mortality. Furthermore, a significant reduction in costs is also expected. In addition, the assistance of the machine will lead to a reduction of the examination time and therefore an optimization of the endoscopic schedule.

This consecutive case series included 164 eyes of 109 patients implanted with the iStent inject\u00ae device with concomitant cataract surgery. The series was comprised of eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (n =\u200984), pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (n =\u200942), normal-tension glaucoma (n =\u200918), and ocular hypertension (n =\u200920). All 164 eyes reached 9\u201314\u2009months of follow-up (\u201c12-month consistent cohort\u201d), with a subset of 88 eyes reaching 21\u201326\u2009months of follow-up (\u201c24-month consistent cohort\u201d). Performance outcome measures included intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of glaucoma medications. Safety outcomes included intra- or postoperative complications, the need for secondary procedures and corrected distance visual acuity. Comparisons of change in continuous (e.g., IOP) and categorical (e.g., proportions of eyes on zero medications) measures between baseline and postoperative times were made with the paired t-test and McNemar\u2019s chi-squared test, respectively. At 12\u2009months postoperatively, IOP was reduced by 25.5% (from 20.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\u2009mmHg to 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009mmHg; p <\u20090.001); at 24\u2009months postoperatively, IOP was reduced by 26.6% (from 20.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u2009mmHg to 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009mmHg; p <\u20090.001). At 12\u2009months postoperatively, mean number of glaucoma medications was reduced by 85.0% (from 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 to 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 medications; p <\u20090.001); at 24\u2009months postoperatively, mean number of medications was reduced by 81.0% (from 2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 to 0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 medications; p\u2009<\u20090.001). After 12\u2009months, 96.3% of eyes had an IOP \u2264 18\u2009mmHg and 58.5% of eyes had an IOP \u2264 15\u2009mmHg, with 81.1% of eyes free of any medication, compared to 1.8% of eyes medication-free in the 12-month cohort at baseline. After 24\u2009months, 98.9% of eyes had an IOP \u2264 18\u2009mmHg and 53.4% of eyes had an IOP \u2264 15\u2009mmHg, with 72.7% free of medication compared to 1.1% of eyes medication-free in the 24-month cohort at baseline. Overall, a high safety profile was observed with no significant postoperative complications. The insertion of iStent inject (comprised of two second-generation trabecular micro-bypass stents) with cataract surgery effectively provides a sustained reduction in IOP with a markedly improved medication burden up to 24\u2009months postoperatively.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://eandv.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40662-019-0169-7", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6953161, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Most previous studies on the classification of GI diseases use only spatial features, which demonstrate low performance in the classification of multiple GI diseases. Although there are a few previous studies using temporal features based on a three-dimensional convolutional neural network, only a specific part of the GI tract was involved with the limited number of classes. To overcome these problems, we propose a comprehensive AI-based framework for the classification of multiple GI diseases by using endoscopic videos, which can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to achieve better classification performance. Two different residual networks and a long short-term memory model are integrated in a cascaded mode to extract spatial and temporal features, respectively. Experiments were conducted on a combined dataset consisting of one of the largest endoscopic videos with 52,471 frames. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework for multi-GI diseases. The experimental results of the proposed model (97.057% area under the curve) demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods and indicate its potential for clinical applications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/7/986/pdf?version=1562649373", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678612, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We have also seen ML techniques being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things (IoT).

In this paper, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease.

Actually, there are two main objectives while enhancing the contrast of an image: (i) improve its appearance for visual interpretation and (ii) facilitate/increase the performance of subsequent tasks (e.g., image analysis, object detection, and image segmentation). Most of the contrast enhancement techniques are based on histogram modifications, which can be performed globally or locally. The Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is a method which can overcome the limitations of global approaches by performing local contrast enhancement. However, this method relies on two essential hyperparameters: the number of tiles and the clip limit. An improper hyperparameter selection may heavily decrease the image quality toward its degradation. Considering the lack of methods to efficiently determine these hyperparameters, this article presents a learning-based hyperparameter selection method for the CLAHE technique. The proposed supervised method was built and evaluated using contrast distortions from well-known image quality assessment datasets. Also, we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 6200 images with a large range of contrast and intensity variations. The results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in predicting CLAHE hyperparameters with up to 0.014 RMSE and 0.935 R2 values. Also, our method overcomes both experimented baselines by enhancing image contrast while keeping its natural aspect.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13640-019-0445-4", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s13640-019-0445-4?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s13640-019-0445-4, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This technique is efficient. We developed the DEEPVESSEL-FFR platform using the emerging deep learning technique to calculate the FFR value out of CTA images in five minutes. This study is to evaluate the DEEPVESSEL-FFR platform using the emerging deep learning technique to calculate the FFR value from CTA images as an efficient method. Methods A single-center, prospective study was conducted and 63 patients were enrolled for the evaluation of the diagnostic performance of DEEPVESSEL-FFR. Automatic quantification method for the three-dimensional coronary arterial geometry and the deep learning based prediction of FFR were developed to assess the ischemic risk of the stenotic coronary arteries. Diagnostic performance of the DEEPVESSEL-FFR was assessed by using wire-based FFR as reference standard. The primary evaluation factor was defined by using the area under receiver-operation characteristics curve (AUC) analysis. Results For per-patient level, taking the cut-off value \u2264 0.8 referring to the FFR measurement, DEEPVESSEL-FFR presented higher diagnostic performance in determining ischemia-related lesions with area under the curve of 0.928 compare to CTA stenotic severity 0.664. DEEPVESSEL-FFR correlated with FFR (R = 0.686, P < 0.001), with a mean difference of \u20130.006 \u00b1 0.0091 (P = 0.619). The secondary evaluation factors, indicating per vessel accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 87.3%, 97.14%, 75%, 82.93%, and 95.45%, respectively.

The proposed HPM consists of Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection to remove the outlier data, Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the distribution of class, and Random Forest (RF) to classify the diseases. Three benchmark datasets were utilized to predict the risk of diabetes and hypertension at the initial stage. The result showed that by integrating DBSCAN-based outlier detection, SMOTE, and RF, diabetes and hypertension could be successfully predicted. The proposed HPM provided the best performance result as compared to other models for predicting diabetes as well as hypertension. Furthermore, our study has demonstrated that the proposed HPM can be applied in real cases in the IoT-based Health-care Monitoring System, so that the input risk-factors from end-user android application can be stored and analyzed in a secure remote server. The prediction result from the proposed HPM can be accessed by users through an Android application; thus, it is expected to provide an effective way to find the risk of diabetes and hypertension at the initial stage.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/8/1325/pdf?version=1534297521", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/APP8081325?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/APP8081325, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based sensors can be considered as a solution for monitoring personal vital signs data. In this study, we propose a personalized healthcare monitoring system by utilizing a BLE-based sensor device, real-time data processing, and machine learning-based algorithms to help diabetic patients to better self-manage their chronic condition. BLEs were used to gather users\u2019 vital signs data such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and blood glucose (BG) from sensor nodes to smartphones, while real-time data processing was utilized to manage the large amount of continuously generated sensor data. The proposed real-time data processing utilized Apache Kafka as a streaming platform and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the patient. The results show that commercial versions of the BLE-based sensors and the proposed real-time data processing are sufficiently efficient to monitor the vital signs data of diabetic patients. Furthermore, machine learning\u2013based classification methods were tested on a diabetes dataset and showed that a Multilayer Perceptron can provide early prediction of diabetes given the user\u2019s sensor data as input. The results also reveal that Long Short-Term Memory can accurately predict the future BG level based on the current sensor data. In addition, the proposed diabetes classification and BG prediction could be combined with personalized diet and physical activity suggestions in order to improve the health quality of patients and to avoid critical conditions in the future.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/7/2183/pdf?version=1530885085", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6068508, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Microscopists commonly examine thick and thin blood smears to diagnose disease and compute parasitemia. However, their accuracy depends on smear quality and expertise in classifying and counting parasitized and uninfected cells. Such an examination could be arduous for large-scale diagnoses resulting in poor quality. State-of-the-art image-analysis based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods using machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to microscopic images of the smears using hand-engineered features demand expertise in analyzing morphological, textural, and positional variations of the region of interest (ROI). In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a class of deep learning (DL) models promise highly scalable and superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. Automated malaria screening using DL techniques could, therefore, serve as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained CNN based DL models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in improved disease screening. We experimentally determine the optimal model layers for feature extraction from the underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrates the use of pre-trained CNNs as a promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://peerj.com/articles/4568.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CC0", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5907772, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Because a urine culture, part of the gold standard for diagnosis of UTI, is usually not available for 24\u201348 hours after an ED visit, diagnosis and treatment decisions are based on symptoms, physical findings, and other laboratory results, potentially leading to overutilization, antibiotic resistance, and delayed treatment. Previous research has demonstrated inadequate diagnostic performance for both individual laboratory tests and prediction tools. Objective Our aim, was to train, validate, and compare machine-learning based predictive models for UTI in a large diverse set of ED patients. Methods Single-center, multi-site, retrospective cohort analysis of 80,387 adult ED visits with urine culture results and UTI symptoms. We developed models for UTI prediction with six machine learning algorithms using demographic information, vitals, laboratory results, medications, past medical history, chief complaint, and structured historical and physical exam findings. Models were developed with both the full set of 211 variables and a reduced set of 10 variables. UTI predictions were compared between models and to proxies of provider judgment (documentation of UTI diagnosis and antibiotic administration). Results The machine learning models had an area under the curve ranging from 0.826\u20130.904, with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) the top performing algorithm for both full and reduced models. The XGBoost full and reduced models demonstrated greatly improved specificity when compared to the provider judgment proxy of UTI diagnosis OR antibiotic administration with specificity differences of 33.3 (31.3\u201334.3) and 29.6 (28.5\u201330.6), while also demonstrating superior sensitivity when compared to documentation of UTI diagnosis with sensitivity differences of 38.7 (38.1\u201339.4) and 33.2 (32.5\u201333.9). In the admission and discharge cohorts using the full XGboost model, approximately 1 in 4 patients (4109/15855) would be re-categorized from a false positive to a true negative and approximately 1 in 11 patients (1372/15855) would be re-categorized from a false negative to a true positive. Conclusion The best performing machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, accurately diagnosed positive urine culture results, and outperformed previously developed models in the literature and several proxies for provider judgment. Future prospective validation is warranted.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194085&type=printable", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841824, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Currently, in differential diagnosis of lung cancer, accurate classification of cancer types (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma) is required. However, improving the accuracy and stability of diagnosis is challenging. In this study, we developed an automated classification scheme for lung cancers presented in microscopic images using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), which is a major deep learning technique. The DCNN used for classification consists of three convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. In evaluation experiments conducted, the DCNN was trained using our original database with a graphics processing unit. Microscopic images were first cropped and resampled to obtain images with resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels and, to prevent overfitting, collected images were augmented via rotation, flipping, and filtering. The probabilities of three types of cancers were estimated using the developed scheme and its classification accuracy was evaluated using threefold cross validation. In the results obtained, approximately 71% of the images were classified correctly, which is on par with the accuracy of cytotechnologists and pathologists. Thus, the developed scheme is useful for classification of lung cancers from microscopic images.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2017/4067832.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5572620, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Here, we review the sources, formation, occurrence, toxicity and remediation methods of microplastics. We distinguish ocean-based and land-based sources of microplastics. Microplastics have been found in biological samples such as faeces, sputum, saliva, blood and placenta. Cancer, intestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, infectious and inflammatory diseases are induced or mediated by microplastics. Microplastic exposure during pregnancy and maternal period is also discussed. Remediation methods include coagulation, membrane bioreactors, sand filtration, adsorption, photocatalytic degradation, electrocoagulation and magnetic separation. Control strategies comprise reducing plastic usage, behavioural change, and using biodegradable plastics. Global plastic production has risen dramatically over the past 70 years to reach 359 million tonnes. China is the world's top producer, contributing 17.5% to global production, while Turkey generates the most plastic waste in the Mediterranean region, at 144 tonnes per day. Microplastics comprise 75% of marine waste, with land-based sources responsible for 80\u201390% of pollution, while ocean-based sources account for only 10\u201320%. Microplastics induce toxic effects on humans and animals, such as cytotoxicity, immune response, oxidative stress, barrier attributes, and genotoxicity, even at minimal dosages of 10 \u03bcg/mL. Ingestion of microplastics by marine animals results in alterations in gastrointestinal tract physiology, immune system depression, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, differential gene expression, and growth inhibition. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of microplastics in the tissues of aquatic organisms can have adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem, with potential transmission of microplastics to humans and birds. Changing individual behaviours and governmental actions, such as implementing bans, taxes, or pricing on plastic carrier bags, has significantly reduced plastic consumption to 8\u201385% in various countries worldwide. The microplastic minimisation approach follows an upside-down pyramid, starting with prevention, followed by reducing, reusing, recycling, recovering, and ending with disposal as the least preferable option.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-023-01593-3.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10072287, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10\u201340% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5\u201330% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97\u201342.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking.

This affects sanitation and public human hygiene, deteriorates quality of life, and contributes to deprivation. This study aimed to test a combination of machine learning, high-resolution earth observation and GIS data to detect diverse categories of residual waste on the streets, such as sacks and construction debris. We conceptualised five different classes of solid waste from image interpretation: \u201cSure\u201d, \u201cHalf-sure\u201d, \u201cNot-sure\u201d, \u201cDispersed\u201d, and \u201cNon-garbage\u201d. We tested a combination of k-means-based segmentation and supervised random forest to investigate the capabilities of automatic classification of these waste classes. The model can detect the presence of solid waste on the streets and achieved an accuracy of up from 73.95%\u201395.76% for the class \u201cSure\u201d. Moreover, a building extraction using an EfficientNet deep-learning-based semantic segmentation allowed masking the rooftops. This improved the accuracy of the classes \u201cSure\u201d and \u201cNon-garbage\u201d. The systematic evaluation of all parameters considered in this model provides a robust and reliable method of solid waste detection for decision-makers. These results highlight areas where insufficient waste management affects the citizens of a given city. Key policy highlights The best segmentation using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) was achieved with the parameter values 8,000 segments and 0.3 compactness. The following supervised classification of the segmented images using Random Forest yielded an average overall accuracy of 80.18%. The model can detect the presence of solid waste on the streets and achieved an accuracy of up from 73.95%\u201395.76% for the class \u201cSure\u201d. The average reflectance values of the classes \u201cSure\u201d and \u201cnon-Garbage\u201d overlapped. Removing the building rooftops from the orthotiles reduced the overlap of the classes mentioned above. This allowed better identification of the class \u201cSure\u201d. Moreover, rooftop removal helped improve the accuracy of the classifier, from 59.51% to 90.18% to 71.53% to 95.76% in study areas with and without rooftops, respectively.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/22797254.2023.2176006", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/22797254.2023.2176006?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/22797254.2023.2176006, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The world's population is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, while solid waste production will reach 2.59 billion tons. This will deteriorate the already strained environment and climate situation. Consequently, there is an urgent need for methods to recycle solid waste. Here, we review recent technologies to treat solid waste, and we assess the economic feasibility of transforming waste into energy. We focus on municipal, agricultural, and industrial waste. We found that methane captured from landfilled-municipal solid waste in Delhi could supply 8\u201318 million houses with electricity and generate 7140 gigawatt-hour, with a prospected potential of 31,346 and 77,748 gigawatt-hour by 2030 and 2060, respectively.

The first section defines the municipal solid waste and solid waste management system. The second section illustrates the descriptive statistical analysis of waste generation patterns in India. The average waste generation in India was 160,038.9 tons per day in 2021; 95% of this total waste was collected and transported to the disposal sites. Based on scientific studies and observations, the per capita waste generation rate in 2018 was 0.490\u20130.626 g per day. In the last one and a half decades (1999\u20132000 to 2015\u20132016), Delhi and Bangalore have shown the highest percentage growth of 2075% and 1750%, respectively, in total waste generation among the highest population cities. The analysis of waste generation patterns concludes urbanization is a major factor that highly influences the waste generation rate. The third section describes the major issues in current solid waste management services. Some of these issues are the unavailability of web portals for citizens, no real-time monitoring of bins, collection vehicles and illegal dumping. These issues are identified based on the survey performed in a city and analysis of related research studies and scientific reports. We determined that illegal dumping is one of these major concerns and needs a technological solution. In the fourth section, we propose a multipath convolutional neural network (mp-CNN) to detect and localize the waste dumps on streets and roadsides. We constructed our dataset to train and test the proposed model, as no benchmark dataset is publicly available to obtain this objective. We applied the weakly supervised learning approach to training the model. In this approach, mp-CNN was trained according to the image class; in our case, it is two (waste and non-waste). In the testing phase, the model showed the performance evaluation matrices 97.82% of precision, 98.86% of recall, 98.34% of F1 score, 98.33% of accuracy, and 98.63% of AUROC for this binary classification. Due to the scarcity of benchmark datasets, waste localization results cannot be presented quantitatively. So, we performed a survey to compare the overlapping of the mask generated by the model with the region waste in the actual image. The average score for the generated mask obtained a score of 3.884 on a scale of 5. Based on the analysis of model performance evaluation parameters, precision-recall curve, receiver characteristic operator curve, and comparison of mask generated by the model over waste with corresponding actual images show that mp-CNN performs remarkably good in detection, classification, and localization of waste regions. Finally, two conceptual architectures in the context of developing countries are suggested to demonstrate the future practical applications of the mp-CNN model.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/23/15896/pdf?version=1669716980", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/su142315896?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/su142315896, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The Korean government implemented a volume-based trash disposal system that may modify waste disposal characteristics to handle vast volumes of waste efficiently. However, the inconvenience of having to purchase standard garbage bags on one\u2019s own led to passive participation by citizens and instances of illegally dumping waste in non-standard plastic bags. As a result, there is a need for the development of automatic detection and reporting of illegal acts of garbage dumping. To achieve this, we suggest a system for tracking unlawful rubbish disposal that is based on deep neural networks. The proposed monitoring approach obtains the articulation points (joints) of a dumper through OpenPose and identifies the type of garbage bag through the object detection model, You Only Look Once (YOLO), to determine the distance of the dumper\u2019s wrist to the garbage bag and decide whether it is illegal dumping. Additionally, we introduced a method of tracking the IDs issued to the waste bags using the multi-object tracking (MOT) model to reduce the false detection of illegal dumping. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed illegal dumping monitoring system, we compared it with the other systems based on behavior recognition. As a result, it was validated that the suggested approach had a higher degree of accuracy and a lower percentage of false alarms, making it useful for a variety of upcoming applications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/22/8819/pdf?version=1669088103", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9696417, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Alternative energy from renewable sources must be utilized to decarbonize the energy sector. However, the adverse effects of climate change, such as increasing temperatures, extreme winds, rising sea levels, and decreased precipitation, may impact renewable energies. Here we review renewable energies with a focus on costs, the impact of climate on renewable energies, the impact of renewable energies on the environment, economy, and on decarbonization in different countries. We focus on solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energy. We observe that the price of solar photovoltaic energy has declined from $0.417 in 2010 to $0.048/kilowatt-hour in 2021. Similarly, prices have declined by 68% for onshore wind, 60% for offshore wind, 68% for concentrated solar power, and 14% for biomass energy. Wind energy and hydropower production could decrease by as much as 40% in some regions due to climate change, whereas solar energy appears the least impacted energy source. Climate change can also modify biomass productivity, growth, chemical composition, and soil microbial communities. Hydroelectric power plants are the most damaging to the environment; and solar photovoltaics must be carefully installed to reduce their impact. Wind turbines and biomass power plants have a minimal environmental impact; therefore, they should be implemented extensively. Renewable energy sources could decarbonize 90% of the electricity industry by 2050, drastically reducing carbon emissions, and contributing to climate change mitigation. By establishing the zero carbon emission decarbonization concept, the future of renewable energy is promising, with the potential to replace fossil fuel-derived energy and limit global temperature rise to 1.5 \u00b0C by 2050.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-022-01532-8.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s10311-022-01532-8?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-022-01532-8, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Here we review circular economy strategies with focus on waste management, climate change, energy, air and water quality, land use, industry, food production, life cycle assessment, and cost-effective routes. We observed that increasing the use of bio-based materials is a challenge in terms of land use and land cover. Carbon removal technologies are actually prohibitively expensive, ranging from 100 to 1200 dollars per ton of carbon dioxide. Politically, only few companies worldwide have set climate change goals. While circular economy strategies can be implemented in various sectors such as industry, waste, energy, buildings, and transportation, life cycle assessment is required to optimize new systems.

Pharmaceuticals have been detected in about 50% of the sludge samples. Sewage sludge contaminants include 19% of diuretics, 16\u201321% of lipid-modifying agents, hydrochlorothiazide, diclofenac, furosemide, clarithromycin, atorvastatin, and carbamazepine. Levels of antibiotics, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and estrone range from 500 to 600 ng/g in sludges from wastewater treatment plants. Remediation methods comprise electrooxidation, ultrasonication, thermal hydrolysis, ozonation, and bioaugmentation. Fermenting the sludges with acidogenic bacteria reduces the level of emerging pollutants in the supernatant. Nonetheless, liquid digestates still contains emerging pollutants such as sunscreen octocrylene at 147 ug/L and acetaminophen at 58.6 ug/L. As a result, pretreatment of sludge containing emerging pollutants is required.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-022-01465-2.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s10311-022-01465-2?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-022-01465-2, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As a consequence, biogas has gained remarkable attention as a local source of both gas for energy and biofertiliser for agriculture. Moreover, climate change-related damage incentivises all sectors to decarbonise and integrate sustainable practices. For instance, anaerobic digestion allows decarbonisation and optimal waste management. Incorporating a biogas system in each country would limit global warming to 2 \u00b0C. If suitable policies mechanisms are implemented, the biogas industry could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 3.29\u20134.36 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which represent about 10\u201313% of global emissions. Here, we review the role of the biogas sector in capturing methane and mitigating carbon emissions associated with biogas outputs. Since biogas impurities can cause severe practical difficulties in biogas storing and gas grid delivering systems, we present upgrading technologies that remove or consume the carbon dioxide in raw biogas, to achieve a minimum of 95% methane content. We discuss the role of hydrogen-assisted biological biogas upgrading in carbon sequestration by converting carbon dioxide to biomethane via utilising hydrogen generated primarily through other renewable energy sources such as water electrolysis and photovoltaic solar facilities or wind turbines. This conceptual shift of 'power to gas' allows storing and utilising the excess of energy generated in grids. By converting carbon dioxide produced during anaerobic digestion into additional biomethane, biogas has the potential to meet 53% of the demand for fossil natural gas. We also evaluate the role of digestate from biogas systems in producing biochar, which can be used directly as a biofertiliser or indirectly as a biomethanation enhancement, upgrading, and cleaning material.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-022-01468-z.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s10311-022-01468-z?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-022-01468-z, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Therefore, an intelligent modeling method for the incineration process in waste-to-energy plants based on deep learning is proposed. First, the output variables were selected from the three aspects of safety, stability and economy. The initial variables related to the output variables were determined by mechanism analysis and the input variables were finally determined by removing invalid and redundant variables through the Lasso algorithm. Secondly, each delay time was calculated, and a multi-input and multi-output model was established on the basis of deep learning. Finally, the deep learning model was compared and verified with traditional models, including LSSVM, CNN, and LSTM.

Selecting and managing waste are a critical part of preserving the environment and maximizing resource efficiency. In addition to reducing trash and disposal, reusable items are predicted to be of great benefit since they lessen our dependence on raw materials. The usage of compostable trash may be expanded outside fertilizers and dung after the metallic, chemicals, and glass items have been recycled. After a good scrubbing, the glass may be broken down and remelted to create new items. Reusing waste items via garbage recovery is one of the best methods to do so. This document outlines the steps that must be taken to maximize the use of garbage. This work describes a reusable industrial robot arm for grasping and sorting things depending on the resources they contain. Gripping, motion control, and object material categorization are all integrated into a full-automation, reusable system architecture in this study. LeNet also was adjusted to classify garbage into cartons and plastics using an artificial intelligent technique, with the use of a customized LeNet model. Movement in terms of moving the robot in the most efficient way possible, the robot's grabbing, and categorization were incorporated into the movement design process.

The advantages of variable domain fuzzy PID control method in position tracking control are verified, the variable domain fuzzy PID can modify the control framework online as per the different position mistake and mistake change rate, the design of the variable domain of input and output makes the fuzzy inference rules locally finer, the speed of adjustment is faster and the tracking accuracy is further improved, so it has finer tracking presentation than the traditional PID tracking management.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2022/5458703.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2022/5458703?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5458703, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Recycling is becoming more and more important, as it is the only way that we can have a clean and sustainable environment. Recycling, however, is a process that is not fully automated; large volumes of waste materials need to be processed manually. New and novel techniques have to be implemented in order to manage the increased volume of waste materials at recycling factories. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that can identify common waste materials as they are being processed on a moving belt in waste collection facilities. An efficient waste material detection and classification system is proposed, which can be used in real integrated solid waste management systems. This system is based on a convolutional neural network and is trained using a custom dataset of images, taken on site from actual moving belts in waste collection facilities. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can outperform existing algorithms found in the literature in real-world conditions, with 92.43% accuracy.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2313-4321/7/1/9/pdf?version=1645668823", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/recycling7010009?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling7010009, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Thus, in this study, we delineate the process for developing an AI model that differentiates between various types of construction waste. Particularly, solutions for solving difficulties in collecting learning data, which is common in AI research in special fields, were also considered. To quantitatively increase the amount of learning data, the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance method was used to increase the amount of learning data by two to three times through augmentation to an appropriate level, thus checking the improvement in the performance of the AI model.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/12/2/175/pdf?version=1645685017", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/buildings12020175?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12020175, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Discovering them as early as possible is of prominent importance for preventing hazards, such as fire pollution and leakage. Before the digital era, the only means to detect illegal waste dumps was the on site inspection of potentially suspicious sites, a procedure extremely costly and impossible to scale to a vast territory. With the advent of Earth observation technology, scanning the territory via aerial images has become possible. However, manual image interpretation remains a complex and time-consuming task that requires expert skill. Photo interpretation can be partially automated by embedding the expert knowledge within a data driven classifier trained with samples provided by human annotators. In this paper, the detection of illegal landfills is formulated as a multi-scale scene classification problem. Scene elements positioning and spatial relations constitute hints of the presence of illegal waste dumps. A dataset of \u22483000 images (20 cm resolution per pixel) was created with the help of expert photo interpreters. A combination of ResNet50 and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) elements accounting for different object scales achieves 88% precision with an 87% of recall in a test area. The results proved the feasibility of applying convolutional neural networks for scene classification in this scenario to optimize the process of waste dumps detection.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/22/4520/pdf?version=1636603872", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs13224520?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224520, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The increase in production of electronic products and the growing inherent need to own the latest technology available has led to a significant increase in the amount of E-waste produced each year. India generated 3.2 million tonnes of E-waste in 2020, with metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore leading the list. Proper management and recycling of E-wastes are critical for the sustainability of any modern city today. While industrial and commercial collection of E-wastes has been in the spotlight, solutions for collection of E-wastes from individual households are limited. This article proposes the implementation of a mobile robot that identifies common electronic wastes based on transfer learning and serves as an attachment to existing municipality garbage trucks. The robot moves around, identifies electronic wastes and performs segregation of the identified material via its arm-based lift and storage mechanism. A convolutional neural network\u2013based identification system has been employed for categorising the E-wastes and yields 96% accuracy. This is a first of its kind attempt, especially in India, to collect and segregate E-wastes from homes and individuals. The system will relieve unskilled labour from the hazardous process while providing a 20% decrease in costs over a 5-year period. The application of this article aims to provide a viable mobile solution for E-waste collection from households with minimal human intervention.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0734242X211052846", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9109239, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In particular, attention should be paid to hazardous waste and methods of its disposal. One of the most used in this context is thermal treatment in dedicated incinerators equipped with a rotary kiln. Conducting the process requires, inter alia, supplying the furnace with a batch of batch material with appropriate parameters. Improper operation in this regard may cause negative environmental effects and operational problems. The key here is to select different types of hazardous waste and compose batch portions. The paper presents an application that optimizes the work of waste incineration plant operators. At the same time, this tool can be described as ensuring security at this stage of the process. The application implements an ant colony algorithm that selects the optimal solution to the problem, which has been formulated here as the types and masses of the batch mixture components with given parameters.

However, there are still some problems with the existing models in waste classification such as low classification accuracy or long running time. Aimed at solving these problems, in this paper, a waste classification method based on a multilayer hybrid convolution neural network (MLH-CNN) is proposed. The network structure of this method is similar to VggNet but simpler, with fewer parameters and a higher classification accuracy. By changing the number of network modules and channels, the performance of the proposed model is improved. Finally, this paper finds the appropriate parameters for waste image classification and chooses the optimal model as the final model. The experimental results show that, compared with some recent works, the proposed method has a simpler network structure and higher waste classification accuracy. A large number of experiments in a TrashNet dataset show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of up to 92.6%, which is 4.18% and 4.6% higher than that of some state-of-the-art methods, and proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/18/8572/pdf?version=1631704140", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/app11188572?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/app11188572, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The data of seventeen experimental tests of polymer mixtures with different compositions were used. A feed-forward back-propagation model, with 15 and 10 neurons in two hidden layers and TANSIG-TANSIG transfer functions, was constructed to predict the weight left percent during the pyrolysis of the mixed polymer samples. The model input variables include the composition of each polymer (PS, PP, LDPE, and HDPE), and temperature. The results showed an excellent agreement between the experimental and the predicted weight left percent values, where the correlation coefficient (R) is greater than 0.9999. In addition, to validate the proposed model, a highly efficient performance was found when the proposed model was simulated using new input data.

Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless either struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors\u2019 opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the \u201cgreen AI\u201d concept as an enabler of the smart city transformation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban futures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach\u2014i.e., green AI\u2014to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city literatures, practices, developments, trends and applications.

Recently, numerous researchers have actively utilized artificial intelligence technology to establish accurate waste generation information. This study investigated the development of machine learning predictive models that can achieve predictive performance on small datasets composed of categorical variables. To this end, the random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithms were adopted. To develop the models, 690 building datasets were established using data preprocessing and standardization. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to develop the RF and GBM models. The model performances were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The study demonstrated that, for small datasets comprising mainly categorical variables, the bagging technique (RF) predictions were more stable and accurate than those of the boosting technique (GBM). However, GBM models demonstrated excellent predictive performance in some DW predictive models. Furthermore, the RF and GBM predictive models demonstrated significantly differing performance across different types of DW. Certain RF and GBM models demonstrated relatively low predictive performance. However, the remaining predictive models all demonstrated excellent predictive performance at R2 values > 0.6, and R values > 0.8. Such differences are mainly because of the characteristics of features applied to model development; we expect the application of additional features to improve the performance of the predictive models. The 11 DW predictive models developed in this study will be useful for establishing detailed DW management strategies.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/16/8530/pdf?version=1628862203", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8392226, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

People shift themselves and their families to urban areas for the sake of better education and a modern lifestyle. Due to rapid urbanization, cities are facing huge challenges, one of which is waste management, as the volume of waste is directly proportional to the people living in the city. The municipalities and the city administrations use the traditional wastage classification techniques which are manual, very slow, inefficient and costly. Therefore, automatic waste classification and management is essential for the cities that are being urbanized for the better recycling of waste. Better recycling of waste gives the opportunity to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by reducing the need to collect new raw material. In this paper, the idea of a real-time smart waste classification model is presented that uses a hybrid approach to classify waste into various classes. Two machine learning models, a multilayer perceptron and multilayer convolutional neural network (ML-CNN), are implemented. The multilayer perceptron is used to provide binary classification, i.e., metal or non-metal waste, and the CNN identifies the class of non-metal waste.

Considering this low recovery rate, lower than many developed nations, and with regards to the increasing rate of C&DW generation, extra attention should be given to the construction and demolition waste management (C&DWM) in Australia. Therefore, this research attempts to accurately understand the current practices and challenges of C&DWM in Australia. To do so, primarily, a systematic review of studies relevant to C&DWM from 2010 to 2021 was performed. In this step, 26 research documents were meticulously analysed to identify the current practices of C&DWM in Australia. Then, an in-depth interview with three experts were undertaken to verify the major results and to investigate the challenges of C&DWM in Australia. The results indicated that three factors significantly affect C&DWM in Australia, namely attitudes and behaviour of C&DWM stakeholders, C&DWM in project life cycles, and C&DWM regulations with regards to sustainability, adding that the latter was revealed as the most effective in C&DWM in Australia.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2313-4321/6/2/34/pdf?version=1621591424", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/RECYCLING6020034?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/RECYCLING6020034, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Manual sorting of garbage is a difficult and expensive process, which is why scientists create and study automated sorting methods that increase the efficiency of the recycling process. The plastic waste may be automatically chosen on a transmission belt for waste removal by using methods of image processing and artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, to improve the recycling process. Waste segregation techniques and procedures are applied to major groups of materials such as paper, plastic, metal, and glass. Though, the biggest challenge is separating different materials types in a group, for example, sorting different colours of glass or plastics types. The issue of plastic garbage is important due to the possibility of recycling only certain types of plastic (PET can be converted into polyester material). Therefore, we should look for ways to separate this waste. One of the opportunities is the use of deep learning and convolutional neural network. In household waste, the most problematic are plastic components, and the main types are polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The main problem considered in this article is creating an automatic plastic waste segregation method, which can separate garbage into four mentioned categories, PS, PP, PE-HD, and PET, and could be applicable on a sorting plant or home by citizens. We proposed a technique that can apply in portable devices for waste recognizing which would be helpful in solving urban waste problems.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/acisc/2021/6626948.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2021/6626948?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6626948, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to digitized whole slide images (WSIs) can aid pathologists in cancer diagnosis, but robust, diverse evidence in a simulated clinical setting is lacking.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE.\u2014\nTo compare the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists reading WSIs of prostatic biopsy specimens with and without AI assistance.\n\n\nDESIGN.\u2014\nEighteen pathologists, 2 of whom were genitourinary subspecialists, evaluated 610 prostate needle core biopsy WSIs prepared at 218 institutions, with the option for deferral. Two evaluations were performed sequentially for each WSI: initially without assistance, and immediately thereafter aided by Paige Prostate (PaPr), a deep learning-based system that provides a WSI-level binary classification of suspicious for cancer or benign and pinpoints the location that has the greatest probability of harboring cancer on suspicious WSIs. Pathologists' changes in sensitivity and specificity between the assisted and unassisted modalities were assessed, together with the impact of PaPr output on the assisted reads.\n\n\nRESULTS.\u2014\nUsing PaPr, pathologists improved their sensitivity and specificity across all histologic grades and tumor sizes. Accuracy gains on both benign and cancerous WSIs could be attributed to PaPr, which correctly classified 100% of the WSIs showing corrected diagnoses in the PaPr-assisted phase.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\u2014\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of an AI tool for pathologists in simulated diagnostic practice, bridging the gap between computational pathology research and its clinical application, and resulted in the first US Food and Drug Administration authorization of an AI system in pathology.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2022-0066-oa", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5858/arpa.2022-0066-oa?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2022-0066-oa, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We demonstrate the use of conformal prediction to detect unreliable predictions, using histopathological diagnosis and grading of prostate biopsies as example. We digitized 7788 prostate biopsies from 1192 men in the STHLM3 diagnostic study, used for training, and 3059 biopsies from 676 men used for testing. With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on. Conformal prediction could with small samples (N\u2009=\u200949 for external scanner, N\u2009=\u200910 for external lab and scanner, and N\u2009=\u200912 for external lab, scanner and pathology assessment) detect systematic differences in external data leading to worse predictive performance. The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80%) unreliable predictions.

Progression of early stages of NAFLD can lead to the more advanced form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and ultimately to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The current gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of NAFLD/NASH is liver biopsy followed by microscopic analysis by a pathologist. The Kleiner score is frequently used for a semi-quantitative assessment of disease progression. In this scoring system the features of active injury (steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning) and a separated fibrosis score are quantified. The procedure is time consuming for pathologists, scores have limited resolution and are subject to variation. We developed an automated deep learning method that provides full reproducibility and higher resolution. The system was established with 296 human liver biopsies and tested on 171 human liver biopsies with pathologist ground truth scores. The method is inspired by the way pathologist's analyze liver biopsies. First, the biopsies are analyzed microscopically for the relevant histopathological features. Subsequently, histopathological features are aggregated to a per-biopsy score.

We applied this spatial cellular-graph strategy to specimens of human head-and-neck and colorectal cancers assayed with 40-plex immunofluorescence imaging to identify spatial motifs associated with cancer recurrence and with patient survival after treatment. The graph deep learning model was substantially more accurate in predicting patient outcomes than deep learning approaches that model spatial data on the basis of the local composition of cell types, and it generated insights into the effect of the spatial compartmentalization of tumour cells and granulocytes on patient prognosis. Local graphs may also aid in the analysis of disease-relevant motifs in histology samples characterized via spatial transcriptomics and other -omics techniques.

Here, we show that PD-L1 expression can be predicted from H&E-stained images by employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. With the help of two expert pathologists and a designed annotation software, we construct a dataset to assess the feasibility of PD-L1 prediction from H&E in breast cancer.

Computationally identifying WSIs with similar morphologic features within large repositories without requiring supervised training can have significant applications. However, the retrieval speeds of algorithms for searching similar WSIs often scale with the repository size, which limits their clinical and research potential. Here we show that self-supervised deep learning can be leveraged to search for and retrieve WSIs at speeds that are independent of repository size. The algorithm, which we named SISH (for self-supervised image search for histology) and provide as an open-source package, requires only slide-level annotations for training, encodes WSIs into meaningful discrete latent representations and leverages a tree data structure for fast searching followed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm for WSI retrieval. We evaluated SISH on multiple tasks (including retrieval tasks based on tissue-patch queries) and on datasets spanning over 22,000 patient cases and 56 disease subtypes. SISH can also be used to aid the diagnosis of rare cancer types for which the number of available WSIs is often insufficient to train supervised deep-learning models.

Due to the sheer size and complexity of multi-gigapixel whole-slide images, to the best of our knowledge, there is no open-source software library providing a generic end-to-end API for pathology image analysis using best practices. Most researchers have designed custom pipelines from the bottom up, restricting the development of advanced algorithms to specialist users. To help overcome this bottleneck, we present TIAToolbox, a Python toolbox designed to make computational pathology accessible to computational, biomedical, and clinical researchers. By creating modular and configurable components, we enable the implementation of computational pathology algorithms in a way that is easy to use, flexible and extensible. We consider common sub-tasks including reading whole slide image data, patch extraction, stain normalization and augmentation, model inference, and visualization. For each of these steps, we provide a user-friendly application programming interface for commonly used methods and models. We demonstrate the use of the interface to construct a full computational pathology deep-learning pipeline. We show, with the help of examples, how state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms can be reimplemented in a streamlined manner using our library with minimal effort. We provide a usable and adaptable library with efficient, cutting-edge, and unit-tested tools for data loading, pre-processing, model inference, post-processing, and visualization. This enables a range of users to easily build upon recent deep-learning developments in the computational pathology literature. Computational software is being introduced to pathology, the study of the causes and effects of disease. Recently various computational pathology algorithms have been developed to analyze digital histology images. However, the software code written for these algorithms often combines functionality from several software packages which have specific setup requirements and code styles. This makes it difficult to re-use this code in other projects. We developed a computational software named TIAToolbox to alleviate this problem and hope this will help accelerate the use of computational software in pathology. Pocock, Graham et al. present TIAToolbox, a Python toolbox for computational pathology.

An accurate prognosis is essential for effective clinical assessment and treatment. Spatial patterns in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are conceptually indicative of the staging and progression of gastric cancer patients. Using spatial patterns of the TME by integrating and transforming the multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images as Cell-Graphs, we propose a graph neural network-based approach, termed C e l l \u2212 G r a p h S i g n a t u r e o r C G S i g n a t u r e , powered by artificial intelligence, for the digital staging of TME and precise prediction of patient survival in gastric cancer. In this study, patient survival prediction is formulated as either a binary ( short-term and long-term ) or ternary ( short-term , medium-term , and long-term ) classification task. Extensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that the C G S i g n a t u r e achieves outstanding model performance, with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.960\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, and 0.771\u2009\u00b1\u20090.024 to 0.904\u2009\u00b1\u20090.012 for the binary- and ternary-classification, respectively. Moreover, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis indicates that the \u201cdigital grade\u201d cancer staging produced by C G S i g n a t u r e provides a remarkable capability in discriminating both binary and ternary classes with statistical significance ( P value <\u20090.0001), significantly outperforming the AJCC 8th edition Tumor Node Metastasis staging system. Using Cell-Graphs extracted from mIHC images, C G S i g n a t u r e improves the assessment of the link between the TME spatial patterns and patient prognosis. Our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of such an artificial intelligence-powered digital staging system in diagnostic pathology and precision oncology.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-022-00285-5.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9226174, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) possess considerable potential in improving the process, the ultrahigh-resolution of whole slide images hinders the development of a clinically applicable solution. We design an artificial-intelligence-assisted LN assessment workflow to facilitate the routine counting of metastatic LNs. Unlike previous patch-based approaches, our proposed method trains CNNs by using 5-gigapixel images, obviating the need for lesion-level annotations. Trained on 5907 LN images, our algorithm identifies metastatic LNs in gastric cancer with a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9936. Clinical experiments reveal that the workflow significantly improves the sensitivity of micrometastasis identification (81.94% to 95.83%, P\u2009<\u2009.001) and isolated tumor cells (67.95% to 96.15%, P\u2009<\u2009.001) in a significantly shorter review time (\u221231.5%, P\u2009<\u2009.001).

Here we show the predictive capacity of integrating medical imaging, histopathologic and genomic features to predict immunotherapy response using a cohort of 247 patients with advanced NSCLC with multimodal baseline data obtained during diagnostic clinical workup, including computed tomography scan images, digitized programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry slides and known outcomes to immunotherapy. Using domain expert annotations, we developed a computational workflow to extract patient-level features and used a machine-learning approach to integrate multimodal features into a risk prediction model. Our multimodal model (area under the curve (AUC)\u2009=\u20090.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74\u20130.86) outperformed unimodal measures, including tumor mutational burden (AUC\u2009=\u20090.61, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.70) and programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry score (AUC\u2009=\u20090.73, 95% CI 0.65\u20130.81). Our study therefore provides a quantitative rationale for using multimodal features to improve prediction of immunotherapy response in patients with NSCLC using expert-guided machine learning.

Known prognostic factors for this disease include homologous recombination deficiency status, age, pathological stage and residual disease status after debulking surgery. Recent work has highlighted important prognostic information captured in computed tomography and histopathological specimens, which can be exploited through machine learning. However, little is known about the capacity of combining features from these disparate sources to improve prediction of treatment response. Here, we assembled a multimodal dataset of 444 patients with primarily late-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer and discovered quantitative features, such as tumor nuclear size on staining with hematoxylin and eosin and omental texture on contrast-enhanced computed tomography, associated with prognosis. We found that these features contributed complementary prognostic information relative to one another and clinicogenomic features. By fusing histopathological, radiologic and clinicogenomic machine-learning models, we demonstrate a promising path toward improved risk stratification of patients with cancer through multimodal data integration.

Recently, spatial omics have enabled spatial tumor profiling, however computational resources that exploit the measurements to quantify tumor heterogeneity in a spatially aware manner are largely missing. We present ATHENA (Analysis of Tumor HEterogeNeity from spAtial omics measurements), a computational framework that facilitates the visualization, processing and analysis of tumor heterogeneity from spatial omics measurements. ATHENA uses graph representations of tumors and bundles together a large collection of established and novel heterogeneity scores that quantify different aspects of the complexity of tumor ecosystems.

In the domain of cancer digital histopathology, we describe a clinically-oriented approach to uncertainty quantification for whole-slide images, estimating uncertainty using dropout and calculating thresholds on training data to establish cutoffs for low- and high-confidence predictions. We train models to identify lung adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma and show that high-confidence predictions outperform predictions without uncertainty, in both cross-validation and testing on two large external datasets spanning multiple institutions. Our testing strategy closely approximates real-world application, with predictions generated on unsupervised, unannotated slides using predetermined thresholds. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty thresholding remains reliable in the setting of domain shift, with accurate high-confidence predictions of adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma for out-of-distribution, non-lung cancer cohorts. Safe clinical deployment of deep learning models for digital pathology requires reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Here the authors describe an algorithm for quantifying whole-slide image uncertainty, demonstrating their approach with models trained to distinguish lung cancer subtypes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34025-x.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04516, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Accurate cell segmentation of the MxIF images is an essential step. We propose a deep learning pipeline to train a Mask R-CNN model (deep network) for cell segmentation using nuclear (DAPI) and membrane (Na+K+ATPase) stained images. We used two-stage domain adaptation by first using a weakly labeled dataset followed by fine-tuning with a manually annotated dataset. We validated our method against manual annotations on three different datasets. Our method yields comparable results to the multi-observer agreement on an ovarian cancer dataset and improves on state-of-the-art performance on a publicly available dataset of mouse pancreatic tissues. Our proposed method, using a weakly labeled dataset for pre-training, showed superior performance in all of our experiments. When using smaller training sample sizes for fine-tuning, the proposed method provided comparable performance to that obtained using much larger training sample sizes. Our results demonstrate that using two-stage domain adaptation with a weakly labeled dataset can effectively boost system performance, especially when using a small training sample size. We deployed the model as a plug-in to CellProfiler, a widely used software platform for cellular image analysis.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08355-1.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8924193, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge\u2014the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers\u2014to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted \u03ba, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840\u20130.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835\u20130.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.

The robustness of a diagnostic DL-based solution is essential for safe clinical deployment.

We compare the effectiveness of model-integrated methods (MC dropout and Deep ensembles) with a model-agnostic approach (Test time augmentation, TTA). Moreover, four uncertainty metrics are compared. Our experiments focus on two domain shift scenarios: a shift to a different medical center and to an underrepresented subtype of cancer. Our results show that uncertainty estimates increase reliability by reducing a model\u2019s sensitivity to classification threshold selection as well as by detecting between 70 and 90% of the mispredictions done by the model.

The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to responses to\u00a0cytotoxic therapy 2 . Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy with or without HER2 (encoded by ERBB2 )-targeted therapy before surgery. Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery 3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a\u00a0pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning.

However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic. Artificial intelligence algorithms trained using chest X-rays consistently underdiagnose pulmonary abnormalities or diseases in historically under-served patient populations, raising ethical concerns about the clinical use of such algorithms.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01595-0.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8674135, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Prostate cancer treatment planning is largely dependent upon examination of core-needle biopsies. The microscopic architecture of the prostate glands forms the basis for prognostic grading by pathologists. Interpretation of these convoluted three-dimensional (3D) glandular structures via visual inspection of a limited number of two-dimensional (2D) histology sections is often unreliable, which contributes to the under- and overtreatment of patients. To improve risk assessment and treatment decisions, we have developed a workflow for nondestructive 3D pathology and computational analysis of whole prostate biopsies labeled with a rapid and inexpensive fluorescent analogue of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. This analysis is based on interpretable glandular features and is facilitated by the development of image translation\u2013assisted segmentation in 3D (ITAS3D). ITAS3D is a generalizable deep learning\u2013based strategy that enables tissue microstructures to be volumetrically segmented in an annotation-free and objective (biomarker-based) manner without requiring immunolabeling. As a preliminary demonstration of the translational value of a computational 3D versus a computational 2D pathology approach, we imaged 300 ex vivo biopsies extracted from 50 archived radical prostatectomy specimens, of which, 118 biopsies contained cancer. The 3D glandular features in cancer biopsies were superior to corresponding 2D features for risk stratification of patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer based on their clinical biochemical recurrence outcomes. The results of this study support the use of computational 3D pathology for guiding the clinical management of prostate cancer. Significance: An end-to-end pipeline for deep learning\u2013assisted computational 3D histology analysis of whole prostate biopsies shows that nondestructive 3D pathology has the potential to enable superior prognostic stratification of patients with prostate cancer.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/82/2/334/3018982/334.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803395, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, training robust AI systems requires large datasets for which data collection faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These obstacles could be overcome with swarm learning (SL), in which partners jointly train AI models while avoiding data transfer and monopolistic data governance. Here, we demonstrate the successful use of SL in large, multicentric datasets of gigapixel histopathology images from over 5,000 patients. We show that AI models trained using SL can predict BRAF mutational status and microsatellite instability directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathology slides of colorectal cancer. We trained AI models on three patient cohorts from Northern Ireland, Germany and the United States, and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom. Our data show that SL-trained AI models outperform most locally trained models, and perform on par with models that are trained on the merged datasets. In addition, we show that SL-based AI models are data efficient. In the future, SL can be used to train distributed AI models for any histopathology image analysis task, eliminating the need for data transfer. A decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning framework used to train a clinically relevant AI system identifies actionable molecular alterations in patients with colorectal cancer by use of routine histopathology slides collected in real-world settings.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01768-5.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9205774, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In contrast, the paucity of large-scale medical datasets hinders the application of machine learning in healthcare. The lack of publicly available multi-centric and diverse datasets mainly stems from confidentiality and privacy concerns around sharing medical data. To demonstrate a feasible path forward in medical image imaging, we conduct a case study of applying a differentially private federated learning framework for analysis of histopathology images, the largest and perhaps most complex medical images. We study the effects of IID and non-IID distributions along with the number of healthcare providers, i.e., hospitals and clinics, and the individual dataset sizes, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, a public repository, to simulate a distributed environment. We empirically compare the performance of private, distributed training to conventional training and demonstrate that distributed training can achieve similar performance with strong privacy guarantees. We also study the effect of different source domains for histopathology images by evaluating the performance using external validation. Our work indicates that differentially private federated learning is a viable and reliable framework for the collaborative development of machine learning models in medical image analysis.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05539-7.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8816913, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Technological advances and the increased focus on precision medicine have recently paved the way for the development of digital pathology-based approaches for quantitative pathologic assessments, namely whole slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013based solutions, allowing us to explore and extract information beyond human visual perception. Within the field of immuno-oncology, the application of such methodologies in drug development and translational research have created invaluable opportunities for deciphering complex pathophysiology and the discovery of novel biomarkers and drug targets. With an increasing number of treatment options available for any given disease, practitioners face the growing challenge of selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient. The ever-increasing utilization of AI-based approaches substantially expands our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, with digital approaches to patient stratification and selection for diagnostic assays supporting the identification of the optimal treatment regimen based on patient profiles. This review provides an overview of the opportunities and limitations around implementing AI-based methods in biomarker discovery and patient selection and discusses how advances in digital pathology and AI should be considered in the current landscape of translational medicine, touching on challenges this technology may face if adopted in clinical settings. The traditional role of pathologists in delivering accurate diagnoses or assessing biomarkers for companion diagnostics may be enhanced in precision, reproducibility, and scale by AI-powered analysis tools.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-021-00919-2", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8491759, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Predictive biomarkers of treatment response are crucial for guiding treatment decisions. With the hypothesis that histological information on tumor biopsy images could predict NAC response in breast cancer, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based biomarker that predicts pCR from images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue and evaluated its predictive performance. In total, 540 breast cancer patients receiving standard NAC were enrolled. Based on H&E-stained images, DL methods were employed to automatically identify tumor epithelium and predict pCR by scoring the identified tumor epithelium to produce a histopathological biomarker, the pCR-score. The predictive performance of the pCR-score was assessed and compared with that of conventional biomarkers including stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) and subtype. The pCR-score derived from H&E staining achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847 in predicting pCR directly, and achieved accuracy, F1 score, and AUC of 0.853, 0.503, and 0.822 processed by the logistic regression method, respectively, higher than either sTILs or subtype; a prediction model of pCR constructed by integrating sTILs, subtype and pCR-score yielded a mean AUC of 0.890, outperforming the baseline sTIL-subtype model by 0.051 (0.839, P \u2009=\u2009 0.001). The DL-based pCR-score from histological images is predictive of pCR better than sTILs and subtype, and holds the great potentials for a more accurate stratification of patients for NAC.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12967-021-03020-z", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8365907, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Deep learning (DL) models have been trained on TCGA to predict numerous features directly from histology, including survival, gene expression patterns, and driver mutations. However, we demonstrate that these features vary substantially across tissue submitting sites in TCGA for over 3,000 patients with six cancer subtypes. Additionally, we show that histologic image differences between submitting sites can easily be identified with DL. Site detection remains possible despite commonly used color normalization and augmentation methods, and we quantify the image characteristics constituting this site-specific digital histology signature. We demonstrate that these site-specific signatures lead to biased accuracy for prediction of features including survival, genomic mutations, and tumor stage. Furthermore, ethnicity can also be inferred from site-specific signatures, which must be accounted for to ensure equitable application of DL. These site-specific signatures can lead to overoptimistic estimates of model performance, and we propose a quadratic programming method that abrogates this bias by ensuring models are not trained and validated on samples from the same site. Deep learning models have been trained on The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict numerous features directly from histology, including survival, gene expression patterns, and driver mutations.

Genomic companion diagnostic tests such as Decipher tend to be tissue destructive, expensive, and not routinely available in most centers. We present a tissue non-destructive method for automated BCR prognosis, termed \"Histotyping\", that employs computational image analysis of morphologic patterns of prostate tissue from a single, routinely acquired hematoxylin and eosin slide. Patients from two institutions ( n \u2009=\u2009214) were used to train Histotyping for identifying high-risk patients based on six features of glandular morphology extracted from RP specimens. Histotyping was validated for post-RP BCR prognosis on a separate set of n \u2009=\u2009675 patients from five institutions and compared against Decipher on n \u2009=\u2009167 patients. Histotyping was prognostic of BCR in the validation set ( p \u2009<\u20090.001, univariable hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20092.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.03\u20133.93, concordance index [c-index]\u2009=\u20090.68, median years-to-BCR: 1.7). Histotyping was also prognostic in clinically stratified subsets, such as patients with Gleason grade group 3 (HR\u2009=\u20094.09) and negative surgical margins (HR\u2009=\u20093.26). Histotyping was prognostic independent of grade group, margin status, pathological stage, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (multivariable p \u2009<\u20090.001, HR\u2009=\u20092.09, 95% CI: 1.40\u20133.10, n \u2009=\u2009648). The combination of Histotyping, grade group, and preoperative PSA outperformed Decipher (c-index\u2009=\u20090.75 vs. 0.70, n \u2009=\u2009167).

This question is particularly important for the early detection of cancer, where high-volume workflows may benefit from (semi-)automated analysis. Here we present a deep learning framework to analyze samples of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test, a minimally invasive alternative to endoscopy, for detecting Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which is the main precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We trained and independently validated the framework on data from two clinical trials, analyzing a combined total of 4,662 pathology slides from 2,331 patients. Our approach exploits decision patterns of gastrointestinal pathologists to define eight triage classes of varying priority for manual expert review. By substituting manual review with automated review in low-priority classes, we can reduce pathologist workload by 57% while matching the diagnostic performance of experienced pathologists. A clinician-in-the-loop deep learning system streamlines the workflow of pathologists for detection of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and retains the diagnostic accuracy of full manual review.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/07/17/2020.07.16.20154732.full.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1038/s41591-021-01287-9?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01287-9, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We present an approach for predicting clinically-relevant molecular phenotypes from whole-slide histopathology images using human-interpretable image features (HIFs). Our method leverages >1.6 million annotations from board-certified pathologists across >5700 samples to train deep learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601\u20130.864), including expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination deficiency, with performance comparable to \u2018black-box\u2019 methods.

We used TissueNet to train Mesmer, a deep-learning-enabled segmentation algorithm. We demonstrated that Mesmer is more accurate than previous methods, generalizes to the full diversity of tissue types and imaging platforms in TissueNet, and achieves human-level performance. Mesmer enabled the automated extraction of key cellular features, such as subcellular localization of protein signal, which was challenging with previous approaches. We then adapted Mesmer to harness cell lineage information in highly multiplexed datasets and used this enhanced version to quantify cell morphology changes during human gestation.

Although certain morphological characteristics of PanNETs have been associated with patient outcome, there are no available morphology-based prognostic markers. Given that current clinical histopathology markers are unable to identify high-risk PanNET patients, the development of accurate prognostic biomarkers is needed. Here, we describe a novel machine learning, multiclassification pipeline to predict the risk of metastasis using morphological information from whole tissue slides. Methods Digital images from surgically resected tissues from 89 PanNET patients were used. Pathologist-annotated regions were extracted to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify tiles consisting of PanNET, stroma, normal pancreas parenchyma, and fat. Computationally annotated cancer or stroma tiles and patient metastasis status were used to train CNN to calculate a region based metastatic risk score. Aggregation of the metastatic probability scores across the slide was performed to predict the risk of metastasis. Results The ability of CNN to discriminate different tissues was high (per-tile accuracy >95%; whole slide cancer regions Jaccard index = 79%). Cancer and stromal tiles with high evaluated probability provided F1 scores of 0.82 and 0.69, respectively, when we compared tissues from patients who developed metastasis and those who did not. The final model identified low-risk (n = 76) and high-risk (n = 13) patients, as well as predicted metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio: 4.71) after adjusting for common clinicopathological variables, especially in grade I/II patients. Conclusion Using slides from surgically resected PanNETs, our novel, multiclassification, deep learning pipeline was able to predict the risk of metastasis in PanNET patients. Our results suggest the presence of prognostic morphological patterns in PanNET tissues, and that these patterns may help guide clinical decision making.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.593211/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946991, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

To alleviate the burden of such contouring and obtain benefits from scaling up training with numerous WSIs, we develop a method for training neural networks on entire WSIs using only slide-level diagnoses. Our method leverages the unified memory mechanism to overcome the memory constraint of compute accelerators. Experiments conducted on a data set of 9662 lung cancer WSIs reveal that the proposed method achieves areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9594 and 0.9414 for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma classification on the testing set, respectively. Furthermore, the method demonstrates higher classification performance than multiple-instance learning as well as strong localization results for small lesions through class activation mapping. Deep learning for digital pathology is hindered by the extremely high spatial resolution of whole slide images (WSIs), which requires researchers to adopt patch-based methods and laborious free-hand contouring.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms can predict the amplification of ERBB2 based on tumor morphological features, but it is not known whether ML-derived features can predict survival and efficacy of anti-ERBB2 treatment. In this study, we trained a deep learning model with digital images of hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E)-stained formalin-fixed primary breast tumor tissue sections, weakly supervised by ERBB2 gene amplification status. The gene amplification was determined by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). The training data comprised digitized tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 1,047 patients. The correlation between the deep learning\u2013predicted ERBB2 status, which we call H&E-ERBB2 score, and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was investigated on a fully independent test set, which included whole-slide tumor images from 712 patients with trastuzumab treatment status available. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in predicting gene amplification in the test sets was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63\u20130.77) on 354 TMA samples and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62\u20130.71) on 712 whole-slide images. Among patients with ERBB2-positive cancer treated with trastuzumab, those with a higher than the median morphology\u2013based H&E-ERBB2 score derived from machine learning had more favorable DDFS than those with a lower score (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15\u20130.93; P\u2009=\u20090.034). A high H&E-ERBB2 score was associated with unfavorable survival in patients with ERBB2-negative cancer as determined by CISH.

The conventional stain normalization usually achieves through a pixel-by-pixel color mapping model, which depends on one reference image, and it is hard to achieve accurately the style transformation between image datasets. In principle, this difficulty can be well-solved by deep learning-based methods, whereas, its complicated structure results in low computational efficiency and artifacts in the style transformation, which has restricted the practical application. Here, we use distillation learning to reduce the complexity of deep learning methods and a fast and robust network called StainNet to learn the color mapping between the source image and the target image. StainNet can learn the color mapping relationship from a whole dataset and adjust the color value in a pixel-to-pixel manner. The pixel-to-pixel manner restricts the network size and avoids artifacts in the style transformation. The results on the cytopathology and histopathology datasets show that StainNet can achieve comparable performance to the deep learning-based methods. Computation results demonstrate StainNet is more than 40 times faster than StainGAN and can normalize a 100,000 \u00d7 100,000 whole slide image in 40 s.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.746307/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12535, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We found that enhancing energy efficiency can significantly contribute to reducing the impact of climate change. Smart manufacturing can reduce energy consumption, waste, and carbon emissions by 30\u201350% and, in particular, can reduce energy consumption in buildings by 30\u201350%. About 70% of the global natural gas industry utilizes artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts. Combining smart grids with artificial intelligence can optimize the efficiency of power systems, thereby reducing electricity bills by 10\u201320%.

For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10\u201340% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5\u201330% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97\u201342.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking. In the electricity sector, artificial intelligence can automate power generation, distribution, and transmission operations, balance the grid without human intervention, enable lightning-speed trading and arbitrage decisions at scale, and eliminate the need for manual adjustments by end-users.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-023-01591-5.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035500, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The impact of droughts on vegetation is essentially manifested as\nthe transition of water shortage from the meteorological to ecological\nstages.

This study proposes a method for calculating the probability of meteorological drought to trigger ecological drought at different magnitudes in northwestern China. In this approach, meteorological and ecological drought events during 1982\u20132020 are identified using the three-dimensional identification method; the propagated drought events are extracted according to a certain spatiotemporal overlap rule, and propagation probability is calculated by coupling the machine learning model and C-vine copula. The results indicate that (1)\u00a046\u00a0drought events are successfully paired with 130 meteorological and 184 ecological drought events during 1982\u20132020, and ecological drought exhibits a longer duration but smaller affected area and severity than meteorological drought; (2)\u00a0a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier performs the best among the 11 commonly used machine learning models which are combined with four-dimensional C-vine copula to construct the drought propagation probability model; and (3)\u00a0the hybrid method considers more drought characteristics and a more detailed propagation process which addresses the limited applicability of the traditional method to regions with large spatial extent.\n", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/27/559/2023/hess-27-559-2023.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.5194/hess-27-559-2023?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-559-2023, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The building infrastructure sector is one of the largest global consumers of electricity and thereby one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing building energy consumption directly contributes to achieving energy sustainability, emissions reduction, and addressing the challenges of a warming planet, while also supporting the rapid urbanization of human society. Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) that are digitalized using advanced sensor technologies are a formal approach that is widely adopted to reduce the energy consumption of building infrastructure. Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocols are a repeatable and transparent methodology to evaluate and formally report on energy savings. As savings cannot be directly measured, they are determined by comparing pre-retrofit and post-retrofit usage of an ECM initiative. Given the computational nature of M&V, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be leveraged to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of M&V protocols. However, AI has been limited to a singular performance metric based on default parameters in recent M&V research. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a comprehensive AI approach for M&V protocols in energy-efficient infrastructure. The novelty of the framework lies in its use of all relevant data (pre and post-ECM) to build robust and explainable predictive AI models for energy savings estimation. The framework was implemented and evaluated in a multi-campus tertiary education institution setting, comprising 200 buildings of diverse sensor technologies and operational functions. The results of this empirical evaluation confirm the validity and contribution of the proposed framework for robust and explainable M&V for energy-efficient building infrastructure and net zero carbon emissions.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/23/9503/pdf?version=1670237423", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9739693, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

One conclusion drawn from the results shows that the benefits of green building implementation include environmental, economic, social, and health and safety aspects.

Alternative energy from renewable sources must be utilized to decarbonize the energy sector. However, the adverse effects of climate change, such as increasing temperatures, extreme winds, rising sea levels, and decreased precipitation, may impact renewable energies. Here we review renewable energies with a focus on costs, the impact of climate on renewable energies, the impact of renewable energies on the environment, economy, and on decarbonization in different countries. We focus on solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energy. We observe that the price of solar photovoltaic energy has declined from $0.417 in 2010 to $0.048/kilowatt-hour in 2021. Similarly, prices have declined by 68% for onshore wind, 60% for offshore wind, 68% for concentrated solar power, and 14% for biomass energy. Wind energy and hydropower production could decrease by as much as 40% in some regions due to climate change, whereas solar energy appears the least impacted energy source. Climate change can also modify biomass productivity, growth, chemical composition, and soil microbial communities. Hydroelectric power plants are the most damaging to the environment; and solar photovoltaics must be carefully installed to reduce their impact. Wind turbines and biomass power plants have a minimal environmental impact; therefore, they should be implemented extensively. Renewable energy sources could decarbonize 90% of the electricity industry by 2050, drastically reducing carbon emissions, and contributing to climate change mitigation.

As a consequence, biogas has gained remarkable attention as a local source of both gas for energy and biofertiliser for agriculture. Moreover, climate change-related damage incentivises all sectors to decarbonise and integrate sustainable practices. For instance, anaerobic digestion allows decarbonisation and optimal waste management. Incorporating a biogas system in each country would limit global warming to 2 \u00b0C. If suitable policies mechanisms are implemented, the biogas industry could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 3.29\u20134.36 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which represent about 10\u201313% of global emissions. Here, we review the role of the biogas sector in capturing methane and mitigating carbon emissions associated with biogas outputs. Since biogas impurities can cause severe practical difficulties in biogas storing and gas grid delivering systems, we present upgrading technologies that remove or consume the carbon dioxide in raw biogas, to achieve a minimum of 95% methane content. We discuss the role of hydrogen-assisted biological biogas upgrading in carbon sequestration by converting carbon dioxide to biomethane via utilising hydrogen generated primarily through other renewable energy sources such as water electrolysis and photovoltaic solar facilities or wind turbines. This conceptual shift of 'power to gas' allows storing and utilising the excess of energy generated in grids. By converting carbon dioxide produced during anaerobic digestion into additional biomethane, biogas has the potential to meet 53% of the demand for fossil natural gas. We also evaluate the role of digestate from biogas systems in producing biochar, which can be used directly as a biofertiliser or indirectly as a biomethanation enhancement, upgrading, and cleaning material.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-022-01468-z.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1007/s10311-022-01468-z?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-022-01468-z, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

For data transfer between heterogeneous devices, IoT requires a stronger communication network and an ideally placed energy-efficient WSN. This study uses deep learning architectures to provide a unique resource allocation method for wireless sensor IoT networks with energy efficiency as well as data optimization. EE (Energy efficiency) and SE (spectral efficiency) are two competing optimization goals in this case. The network\u2019s energy efficiency has been improved because of a deep neural network based on whale optimization. The heuristic-based multi-objective firefly algorithm was used to optimise the data. This proposed method is applied to optimal power allocation and relay selection. The study is for a cooperative multi-hop network topology. The best resource allocation is achieved by reducing overall transmit power, and the best relay selection is accomplished by meeting Quality of Service (QoS) standards. As a result, an energy-efficient protocol has been created. The simulation results demonstrate the suggested model\u2019s competitive performance when compared to traditional models in terms of throughput of 96%, energy efficiency of 95%, QoS of 75%, spectrum efficiency of 85%, and network lifetime of 91 percent.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/13/2071/pdf?version=1656673498", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/electronics11132071?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11132071, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Moreover, synergies between different countries have hampered synergies between adaptation and mitigation policies, as well as their co-benefits. Here, we present a strategy to reach a carbon neutral economy by examining the outcome goals of the 26th summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26). Methods have been designed for mapping carbon emissions, such as input\u2013output models, spatial systems, geographic information system maps, light detection and ranging techniques, and logarithmic mean divisia. We present decarbonization technologies and initiatives, and negative emissions technologies, and we discuss carbon trading and carbon tax. We propose plans for carbon neutrality such as shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy, and the development of low-carbon technologies, low-carbon agriculture, changing dietary habits and increasing the value of food and agricultural waste. Developing resilient buildings and cities, introducing decentralized energy systems, and the electrification of the transportation sector is also necessary.

This classification is essential for sustainable development in agricultural decisions and urban planning using deep learning (DL) methods. DL gets more attention for accuracy and performance improvements in large datasets. This paper is aimed to apply one of the DL methods called transfer learning (TL). TL is the recent research problem in machine learning and DL approaches for image classification. DL consumes much time for training when starting from scratch. This problem could be overcome in the TL modeling technique, which uses pre-trained models to build deep TL models efficiently. We applied the TL model using bottleneck feature extraction from the pre-trained models: InceptionV3, Resnet50V2, and VGG19 to LCLU classification in the UC Merced dataset.

This paper describes the design and development of a water-fertilizer control system based on the soil conductivity threshold. The system uses a low-cost wireless sensor network as a data collection and transmission tool and transmits the data to the decision support system. The decision support system considers the change in soil electrical conductivity (EC) and moisture content to guide the application of water-fertilizer, and then improves the fertilization accuracy of the water-fertilizer control system. In the experiment, the proposed water-fertilizer control system was tested, and it was concluded that, compared with the existing traditional water-fertilizer integration control system, the amount of fertilizer used by the system was reduced by 10.89% on average, and it could save 0.76\u20130.87 tons of fertilizer throughout the whole growth period of cotton.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/10/1693/pdf?version=1632636599", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/pr9101693?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/pr9101693, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Over the past few years, organizations are increasingly turning to AI in order to gain business value following a deluge of data and a strong increase in computational capacity. Nevertheless, organizations are still struggling to adopt and leverage AI in their operations. The lack of a coherent understanding of how AI technologies create business value, and what type of business value is expected, therefore necessitates a holistic understanding. This study provides a systematic literature review that attempts to explain how organizations can leverage AI technologies in their operations and elucidate the value-generating mechanisms. Our analysis synthesizes the current literature and highlights: (1) the key enablers and inhibitors of AI adoption and use; (2) the typologies of AI use in the organizational setting; and (3) the first- and second-order effects of AI.

However, RR data are scarce, especially in regions with poor radar coverage or substantial terrain obstructions. Fortunately, the radiance data of space-based satellites with universal coverage can be converted into a proxy field of RR. In this study, a convolutional neural network-based data-driven model is developed to convert the radiance data (infrared bands 07, 09, 13, 16, and 16\u201313) of Himawari-8 into the radar combined reflectivity factor (CREF). A weighted loss function is designed to solve the data imbalance problem due to the sparse convective pixels in the sample. The developed model demonstrates an overall reconstruction capability and performs well in terms of classification scores with 35 dBZ as the threshold. A five-channel input is more efficient in reconstructing the CREF than the commonly used one-channel input. In a case study of a convective event over North China in the summer using the test dataset, U-Net reproduces the location, shape and strength of the convective storm well. The present RR reconstruction technology based on deep learning and Himawari-8 radiance data is shown to be an efficient tool for producing high-resolution RR products, which are especially needed for regions without or with poor radar coverage.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/16/3330/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/rs13163330?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13163330, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, with proper operation, significant energy savings can be achieved. Demand response is envisioned as a key enabler of this operation enhancement, as it may contribute to the reduction of demand peaks and maximization of renewable energy exploitation while mitigating potential problems with grid stability. In this article, a system based on artificial intelligence that solves the complex multi-objective problem to bring demand response programs to the residential sector is proposed. Through the application of novel machine learning-based algorithms, a unique control loop is developed to help dwellers determine how and when to use their appliances. The feasibility and validity of the proposed system has been demonstrated in a real-world neighbourhood where a notable reduction and shift of electricity demand peaks has been achieved. Concretely, in accordance with extreme changes in the energy prices, the users have demonstrated the ability to shift their demand to periods with lower prices as well as reducing power consumption during periods with higher prices, thus fully translating the demand peak in time.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/6/693/pdf?version=1615883814", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/ELECTRONICS10060693?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/ELECTRONICS10060693, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In Italy, the production of ready-to-eat salad in greenhouses requires usually from 8 to 12 treatments per year. Moreover, inappropriate sprayers are frequently used, being originally designed for open-field operations. To solve this problem, a small vehicle suitable for moving over rough ground (named \u201crover\u201d), was designed, able to carry out treatments based on a single row pass in the greenhouse, devoted to reduce significantly the sprayed product amount. To ascertain its potential, the prototype has been tested at two growth stages of some salad cultivars, adopting different nozzles and boom settings. Parameters such as boom height, nozzle spacing and inclination, pump pressure and rover traveling speed were studied. To assess the effectiveness of the spraying coverage, for each run several water-sensitive papers were placed throughout the vegetation.

This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations\u2019 current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers.

The MobileNet V2 model proved to be efficient with a better accuracy that can work on lightweight computational devices. The proposed model is efficient in maintaining stateful information for precise predictions. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix is used for assessing the progress of diseased growth. The performance has been compared against other state-of-the-art models such as Fine-Tuned Neural Networks (FTNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition developed by Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and convolutional neural network architecture that expanded with few changes.

In phase 2, sequential testing was run to evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT to diagnose COVID 19 according to 2 scenarios before and after adding RT-PCR test result. \nResults: CT scan has a high sensitivity to diagnosing cases of COVID 19. Due to its low specificity, relying on CT scan to diagnose COVID 19 alone in medical centers, can lead to a significant proportion of false positive cases. This Study showed if the probability of COVID 19 before the CT scan were about 50%, with a positive CT scan, this probability will be between 60 and 70% depending on the CT specificity. \nConclusion: With the available evidence, the use of CT scan lonely is not sufficient for diagnosis. The RT-PCR test is also necessary to improve the diagnosis and continue the process of treatment and isolation of patients.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.18502/htaa.v4i1.5866", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.18502/HTAA.V4I1.5866?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.18502/HTAA.V4I1.5866, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Predicting heart disease is a complex task since it requires experience along with advanced knowledge. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has lately been adopted in healthcare systems to collect sensor values for heart disease diagnosis and prediction. Many researchers have focused on the diagnosis of heart disease, yet the accuracy of the diagnosis results is low. To address this issue, an IoT framework is proposed to evaluate heart disease more accurately using a Modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN). The smartwatch and heart monitor device that is attached to the patient monitors the blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG). The MDCNN is utilized for classifying the received sensor data into normal and abnormal. The performance of the system is analyzed by comparing the proposed MDCNN with existing deep learning neural networks and logistic regression. The results demonstrate that the proposed MDCNN based heart disease prediction system performs better than other methods. The proposed method shows that for the maximum number of records, the MDCNN achieves an accuracy of 98.2 which is better than existing classifiers.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09000918.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05999, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We aimed to assess the validity of computed tomography (CT) quantitative and qualitative analysis in COVID-19 pneumonia and how it can predict the disease severity on admission. Results One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled in our study, 98 (81.7%) of them were males, and 22 (18.3%) of them were females with a mean age of 52.63 \u00b1 12.79\u2009years old, ranging from 28 to 83\u2009years. Groups B and C showed significantly increased number of involved lung segments and lobes, frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram. The total lung severity score and the total score for crazy-paving and consolidation are used as severity indicators in the qualitative method and could differentiate between groups B and C and group A (90.9% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, and 93.2% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, respectively), while the quantitative indicators could differentiate these three groups. Using the quantitative CT indicators, the validity to differentiate different groups showed 84.1% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity for the opacity score, and 90.9% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity for the percentage of high opacity.

According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke. When we eat, our body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas is supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a key to open our cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow us to use the glucose for energy. But with diabetes, this system does not work. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common forms of the disease, but there are also other kinds, such as gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, as well as other forms. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. The algorithms like K nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Random forest, Support vector machine and Decision tree are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the diabetes.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.32628/cseit206463", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32628/cseit206463?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32628/cseit206463, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Hence, it is necessary to distinguish the importance of risk factors of cervical cancer to classify potential patients. The present work proposes a cervical cancer prediction model (CCPM) that offers early prediction of cervical cancer using risk factors as inputs. The CCPM first removes outliers by using outlier detection methods such as density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and isolation forest (iForest) and by increasing the number of cases in the dataset in a balanced way, for example, through synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and SMOTE with Tomek link (SMOTETomek). Finally, it employs random forest (RF) as a classifier. Thus, CCPM lies on four scenarios: (1) DBSCAN + SMOTETomek + RF, (2) DBSCAN + SMOTE+ RF, (3) iForest + SMOTETomek + RF, and (4) iForest + SMOTE + RF. A dataset of 858 potential patients was used to validate the performance of the proposed method. We found that combinations of iForest with SMOTE and iForest with SMOTETomek provided better performances than those of DBSCAN with SMOTE and DBSCAN with SMOTETomek. We also observed that RF performed the best among several popular machine learning classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed CCPM showed better accuracy than previously proposed methods for forecasting cervical cancer. In addition, a mobile application that can collect cervical cancer risk factors data and provides results from CCPM is developed for instant and proper action at the initial stage of cervical cancer.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/10/2809/pdf?version=1589870093", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284557, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Chronic diseases (CDs) are responsible for a major portion of global health costs. Patients who suffer from these diseases need lifelong treatment. Nowadays, predictive models are frequently applied in the diagnosis and forecasting of these diseases. In this study, we reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches that encompass ML models in the primary diagnosis of CD. This analysis covers 453 papers published between 2015 and 2019, and our document search was conducted from PubMed (Medline), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) libraries. Ultimately, 22 studies were selected to present all modeling methods in a precise way that explains CD diagnosis and usage models of individual pathologies with associated strengths and limitations. Our outcomes suggest that there are no standard methods to determine the best approach in real-time clinical practice since each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the methods considered, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), clustering were the most commonly used. These models are highly applicable in classification, and diagnosis of CD and are expected to become more important in medical practice in the near future.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/10/2/21/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354442, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

We tested the possibility of machine learning models to predict future incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) using large-scale administrative health data. From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2002 and 2010, we obtained de-identified health data in elders above 65 years ( N \u2009=\u200940,736) containing 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness and socio-demographics. To define incident AD we considered two operational definitions: \u201cdefinite AD\u201d with diagnostic codes and dementia medication ( n \u2009=\u2009614) and \u201cprobable AD\u201d with only diagnosis ( n \u2009=\u20092026). We trained and validated random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1, 2, 3, and 4 subsequent years. For predicting future incidence of AD in balanced samples (bootstrapping), the machine learning models showed reasonable performance in 1-year prediction with AUC of 0.775 and 0.759, based on \u201cdefinite AD\u201d and \u201cprobable AD\u201d outcomes, respectively; in 2-year, 0.730 and 0.693; in 3-year, 0.677 and 0.644; in 4-year, 0.725 and 0.683. The results were similar when the entire (unbalanced) samples were used. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level, age and urine protein level. This study may shed a light on the utility of the data-driven machine learning model based on large-scale administrative health data in AD risk prediction, which may enable better selection of individuals at risk for AD in clinical trials or early detection in clinical settings.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0256-0.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7099065, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

It is estimated at about 60% of all deaths worldwide and approximately 43% of the global burden of chronic diseases. Thus, the analysis of the healthcare data has helped health officials, patients, and healthcare communities to perform early detection for those diseases. Extracting the patterns from healthcare data has helped the healthcare communities to obtain complete medical data for the purpose of diagnosis. The objective of the present research work is presented to improve the surveillance detection system for chronic diseases, which is used for the protection of people's lives. For this purpose, the proposed system has been developed to enhance the detection of chronic disease by using machine learning algorithms. The standard data related to chronic diseases have been collected from various worldwide resources. In healthcare data, special chronic diseases include ambiguous objects of the class. Therefore, the presence of ambiguous objects shows the availability of traits involving two or more classes, which reduces the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. The novelty of the current research work lies in the assumption that demonstrates the noncrisp Rough K-means (RKM) clustering for figuring out the ambiguity in chronic disease dataset to improve the performance of the system. The RKM algorithm has clustered data into two sets, namely, the upper approximation and lower approximation. The objects belonging to the upper approximation are favourable objects, whereas the ones belonging to the lower approximation are excluded and identified as ambiguous. These ambiguous objects have been excluded to improve the machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithms, namely, na\u00efve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest tree, are presented and compared. The chronic disease data are obtained from the machine learning repository and Kaggle to test and evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is successfully employed for the diagnosis of chronic diseases. The proposed model achieved the best results with naive Bayes with RKM for the classification of diabetic disease (80.55%), whereas SVM with RKM for the classification of kidney disease achieved 100% and SVM with RKM for the classification of cancer disease achieved 97.53 with respect to accuracy metric. The performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score, are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Furthermore, evaluation and comparison of the proposed system with the existing machine learning algorithms are presented. Finally, the proposed system has enhanced the performance of machine learning algorithms.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2020/4984967.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7085388, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, to date, it has been challenging to generate magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images with synthetic MRI. The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning algorithm to generate MRA images based on 3D synthetic MRI raw data.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nEleven healthy volunteers and 4 patients with intracranial aneurysms were included in this study. All participants underwent a time-of-flight (TOF) MRA sequence and a 3D-QALAS synthetic MRI sequence. The 3D-QALAS sequence acquires 5 raw images, which were used as the input for a deep learning network. The input was converted to its corresponding MRA images by a combination of a single-convolution and a U-net model with a 5-fold cross-validation, which were then compared with a simple linear combination model. Image quality was evaluated by calculating the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measurements (SSIMs), and high frequency error norm (HFEN). These calculations were performed for deep learning MRA (DL-MRA) and linear combination MRA (linear-MR), relative to TOF-MRA, and compared with each other using a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Overall image quality and branch visualization, each scored on a 5-point Likert scale, were blindly and independently rated by 2 board-certified radiologists.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDeep learning MRA was successfully obtained in all subjects. The mean PSNR, SSIM, and HFEN of the DL-MRA were significantly higher, higher, and lower, respectively, than those of the linear-MRA (PSNR, 35.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs 34.0 \u00b1 0.5, P < 0.001; SSIM, 0.93 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.82 \u00b1 0.02, P < 0.001; HFEN, 0.61 \u00b1 0.08 vs 0.86 \u00b1 0.05, P < 0.001). The overall image quality of the DL-MRA was comparable to that of TOF-MRA (4.2 \u00b1 0.7 vs 4.4 \u00b1 0.7, P = 0.99), and both types of images were superior to that of linear-MRA (1.5 \u00b1 0.6, for both P < 0.001). No significant differences were identified between DL-MRA and TOF-MRA in the branch visibility of intracranial arteries, except for ophthalmic artery (1.2 \u00b1 0.5 vs 2.3 \u00b1 1.2, P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMagnetic resonance angiography generated by deep learning from 3D synthetic MRI data visualized major intracranial arteries as effectively as TOF-MRA, with inherently aligned quantitative maps and multiple contrast-weighted images. Our proposed algorithm may be useful as a screening tool for intracranial aneurysms without requiring additional scanning time.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://journals.lww.com/investigativeradiology/Fulltext/2020/04000/Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Generating_MRA_Images.8.aspx", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBYNCND", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1097/RLI.0000000000000628?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0000000000000628, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Real-time monitoring of patients is an important research area of medical AI. The medical AI is very closely related to the Internet of Things (IoT), a core element of the fourth industrial revolution. Attempts to diagnose and treat patients using IoT have been already applied to patients with chronic disease such as hypertension and arrhythmia. However, in the spine, research on IoT and digital biomarkers are still in the early stages. The digital biomarker obtained by IoT devices is objective and could represent real-time, real-world, and abundant data. Based on its characteristics, IoT and digital biomarkers can also be useful in the spine. Currently, research on real-time monitoring of physical activity or spinal posture is ongoing.

However, end-to-end learning that is capable of maximizing the impact of deep learning has yet to receive much attention due to the endemic challenge of neuroimaging caused by the scarcity of data. Thus, this study presents an approach meant to encourage the end-to-end learning of a volumetric convolutional neural network (CNN) model for four binary classification tasks (AD vs. normal control (NC), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) vs. NC, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visualizes its outcomes in terms of the decision of the CNNs without any human intervention. In the proposed approach, we use convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based unsupervised learning for the AD vs. NC classification task, and supervised transfer learning is applied to solve the pMCI vs. sMCI classification task. To detect the most important biomarkers related to AD and pMCI, a gradient-based visualization method that approximates the spatial influence of the CNN model\u2019s decision was applied. To validate the contributions of this study, we conducted experiments on the ADNI database, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved the accuracies of 86.60% and 73.95% for the AD and pMCI classification tasks respectively, outperforming other network models. In the visualization results, the temporal and parietal lobes were identified as key regions for classification.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54548-6.pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6890708, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Internet of Things has witnessed the transition in life for the last few years which provides a way to analyze both the real-time data and past data by the emerging role of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. The current state-of-the-art method does not effectively diagnose the breast cancer in the early stages, and most of the ladies suffered from this dangerous disease. Thus, the early detection of breast cancer significantly poses a great challenge for medical experts and researchers. To solve the problem of early-stage detection of breast cancer, we proposed machine learning-based diagnostic system which effectively classifies the malignant and benign people in the environment of IoT. In the development of our proposed system, a machine learning classifier support vector machine is used to classify the malignant and benign people. To improve the classification performance of the classification system, we used a recursive feature selection algorithm to select more suitable features from the breast cancer dataset. The training/testing splits method is applied for training and testing of the classifier for the best predictive model. Additionally, the classifier performance has been checked on by using performance evaluation metrics such as classification, specificity, sensitivity, Matthews\u2019s correlation coefficient, F1-score, and execution time. To test the proposed method, the dataset \u201cWisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer\u201d has been used in this research study. The experimental results demonstrate that the recursive feature selection algorithm selects the best subset of features, and the classifier SVM achieved optimal classification performance on this best subset of features. The SVM kernel linear achieved high classification accuracy (99%), specificity (99%), and sensitivity (98%), and the Matthews\u2019s correlation coefficient is 99%. From these experimental results, we concluded that the proposed system performance is excellent due to the selection of more appropriate features that are selected by the recursive feature selection algorithm. Furthermore, we suggest this proposed system for effective and efficient early stages diagnosis of breast cancer. Thus, through this system, the recovery and treatment will be more effective for breast cancer. Lastly, the implementation of the proposed system is very reliable in all aspects of IoT healthcare for breast cancer.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5176705", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2019/5176705?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5176705, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Despite increased awareness, the delay to diagnosis remains unchanged. This study explores whether a predictive model based on healthcare resource utilisation can be used to screen large populations to identify patients at high risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service in England, providing close to full national coverage, were used as a measure of healthcare resource utilisation. Data for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension from the National Pulmonary Hypertension Service in Sheffield were linked to pre-diagnosis Hospital Episode Statistics records. A non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension control cohort was selected from the Hospital Episode Statistics population. Patient history was limited to \u22645 years pre-diagnosis. Information on demographics, timing/frequency of diagnoses, medical specialities visited and procedures undertaken was captured. For modelling, a bagged gradient boosting trees algorithm was used to discriminate between cohorts. Between 2008 and 2016, 709 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were identified and compared with a stratified cohort of 2,812,458 patients classified as non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with \u22651 ICD-10 coded diagnosis of relevance to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. A predictive model was developed and validated using cross-validation. The timing and frequency of the clinical speciality seen, secondary diagnoses and age were key variables driving the algorithm\u2019s performance. To identify the 100 patients at highest risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, 969 patients would need to be screened with a specificity of 99.99% and sensitivity of 14.10% based on a prevalence of 5.5/million. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 10.32% and 99.99%, respectively. This study highlights the potential application of artificial intelligence to readily available real-world data to screen for rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This algorithm could provide low-cost screening at a population level, facilitating earlier diagnosis, improved diagnostic rates and patient outcomes.

However, inflammation is not the only process involved in atherogenesis and we hypothesized that additional radiomic signatures of adverse fibrotic and microvascular PVAT remodelling, may further improve cardiac risk prediction. Methods and results We present a new artificial intelligence-powered method to predict cardiac risk by analysing the radiomic profile of coronary PVAT, developed and validated in patient cohorts acquired in three different studies. In Study 1, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 167 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and the expression of genes representing inflammation, fibrosis and vascularity was linked with the radiomic features extracted from tissue CT images. Adipose tissue wavelet-transformed mean attenuation (captured by FAI) was the most sensitive radiomic feature in describing tissue inflammation (TNFA expression), while features of radiomic texture were related to adipose tissue fibrosis (COL1A1 expression) and vascularity (CD31 expression). In Study 2, we analysed 1391 coronary PVAT radiomic features in 101 patients who experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 5\u2009years of having a CCTA and 101 matched controls, training and validating a machine learning (random forest) algorithm (fat radiomic profile, FRP) to discriminate cases from controls (C-statistic 0.77 [95%CI: 0.62\u20130.93] in the external validation set). The coronary FRP signature was then tested in 1575 consecutive eligible participants in the SCOT-HEART trial, where it significantly improved MACE prediction beyond traditional risk stratification that included risk factors, coronary calcium score, coronary stenosis, and high-risk plaque features on CCTA (\u0394[C-statistic] = 0.126, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In Study 3, FRP was significantly higher in 44 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction compared with 44 matched controls, but unlike FAI, remained unchanged 6 months after the index event, confirming that FRP detects persistent PVAT changes not captured by FAI. Conclusion The CCTA-based radiomic profiling of coronary artery PVAT detects perivascular structural remodelling associated with coronary artery disease, beyond inflammation. A new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered imaging biomarker (FRP) leads to a striking improvement of cardiac risk prediction over and above the current state-of-the-art.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-pdf/40/43/3529/30739503/ehz592.pdf", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6855141, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Among the diseases, diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of vision detachment, can be diagnosed early through the detection of retinal vessels. The manual detection of these retinal vessels is a time-consuming process that can be automated with the help of artificial intelligence with deep learning. The detection of vessels is difficult due to intensity variation and noise from non-ideal imaging. Although there are deep learning approaches for vessel segmentation, these methods require many trainable parameters, which increase the network complexity. To address these issues, this paper presents a dual-residual-stream-based vessel segmentation network (Vess-Net), which is not as deep as conventional semantic segmentation networks, but provides good segmentation with few trainable parameters and layers. The method takes advantage of artificial intelligence for semantic segmentation to aid the diagnosis of retinopathy. To evaluate the proposed Vess-Net method, experiments were conducted with three publicly available datasets for vessel segmentation: digital retinal images for vessel extraction (DRIVE), the Child Heart Health Study in England (CHASE-DB1), and structured analysis of retina (STARE). Experimental results show that Vess-Net achieved superior performance for all datasets with sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy (Acc) of 80.22%, 98.1%, 98.2%, and 96.55% for DRVIE; 82.06%, 98.41%, 98.0%, and 97.26% for CHASE-DB1; and 85.26%, 97.91%, 98.83%, and 96.97% for STARE dataset.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/9/1446/pdf?version=1568713216", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6780110, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Most previous studies on the classification of GI diseases use only spatial features, which demonstrate low performance in the classification of multiple GI diseases. Although there are a few previous studies using temporal features based on a three-dimensional convolutional neural network, only a specific part of the GI tract was involved with the limited number of classes. To overcome these problems, we propose a comprehensive AI-based framework for the classification of multiple GI diseases by using endoscopic videos, which can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to achieve better classification performance. Two different residual networks and a long short-term memory model are integrated in a cascaded mode to extract spatial and temporal features, respectively. Experiments were conducted on a combined dataset consisting of one of the largest endoscopic videos with 52,471 frames. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework for multi-GI diseases. The experimental results of the proposed model (97.057% area under the curve) demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods and indicate its potential for clinical applications.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/7/986/pdf?version=1562649373", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6678612, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With the rapid development of technologies and the application of various data mining techniques in recent years, the progress of dermatological predictive classification has become more and more predictive and accurate. Therefore, development of machine learning techniques, which can effectively differentiate skin disease classification, is of vast importance. The machine learning techniques applied to skin disease prediction so far, no techniques outperforms over all the others. Methods: In this research paper, we present a new method, which applies five different data mining techniques and then developed an ensemble approach that consists all the five different data mining techniques as a single unit. We use informative Dermatology data to analysis different data mining techniques to classify the skin disease and then, an ensemble machine learning method is applied. Results: The proposed ensemble method, which is based on machine learning was tested on Dermatology datasets and classify the type of skin disease in six different classes like include C1: psoriasis, C2: seborrheic dermatitis, C3: lichen planus, C4: pityriasis rosea, C5: chronic dermatitis, C6: pityriasis rubra. The results show that the dermatological prediction accuracy of the test data set is increased compared to a single classifier.

An advantage of Char-RNN is that it does not require any additional imputation method because it implicitly infers missing values considering the relationship with nearby data points. We applied Char-RNN to classify cases in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) VI as normal status and five chronic diseases: hypertension, stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus. We also employed a multilayer perceptron network for the same task for comparison. The results show higher accuracy for Char-RNN than for the conventional multilayer perceptron model.

The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as\u2014omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00220/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00931, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The BG level is preferably maintained close to normality through self-management practices, which involves actively tracking BG levels and taking proper actions including adjusting diet and insulin medications. BG anomalies could be defined as any undesirable reading because of either a precisely known reason (normal cause variation) or an unknown reason (special cause variation) to the patient. Recently, machine-learning applications have been widely introduced within diabetes research in general and BG anomaly detection in particular. However, irrespective of their expanding and increasing popularity, there is a lack of up-to-date reviews that materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies for BG anomaly classification and detection in people with diabetes. Objective This review aimed to identify, assess, and analyze the state-of-the-art machine-learning strategies and their hybrid systems focusing on BG anomaly classification and detection including glycemic variability (GV), hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes within the context of personalized decision support systems and BG alarm events applications, which are important constituents for optimal diabetes self-management. Methods A rigorous literature search was conducted between September 1 and October 1, 2017, and October 15 and November 5, 2018, through various Web-based databases. Peer-reviewed journals and articles were considered. Information from the selected literature was extracted based on predefined categories, which were based on previous research and further elaborated through brainstorming. Results The initial results were vetted using the title, abstract, and keywords and retrieved 496 papers. After a thorough assessment and screening, 47 articles remained, which were critically analyzed. The interrater agreement was measured using a Cohen kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. The state-of-the-art classes of machine learning have been developed and tested up to the task and achieved promising performance including artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, genetic algorithm, Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural network, deep belief network, and others. Conclusions Despite the complexity of BG dynamics, there are many attempts to capture hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia incidences and the extent of an individual\u2019s GV using different approaches. Recently, the advancement of diabetes technologies and continuous accumulation of self-collected health data have paved the way for popularity of machine learning in these tasks. According to the review, most of the identified studies used a theoretical threshold, which suffers from inter- and intrapatient variation. Therefore, future studies should consider the difference among patients and also track its temporal change over time. Moreover, studies should also give more emphasis on the types of inputs used and their associated time lag. Generally, we foresee that these developments might encourage researchers to further develop and test these systems on a large-scale basis.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.jmir.org/2019/5/e11030/PDF", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6658321, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

METHODS Consecutive patients who required bariatric surgery underwent a liver biopsy during the operation. Standard clinical, anthropometric, biochemical measurements were used as parameters to predict NASH and were analyzed using rule extraction technology. One hundred and two patients, including 79 NASH and 23 non-NASH patients were analyzed in order to create the prediction model, another cohort with 77 patients including 65 NASH and 12 non-NASH patients were analyzed to validate the algorithm. RESULTS Alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, albumin were extracted as predictors of NASH using a recursive-rule extraction algorithm. When we adopted the extracted rules for the validation cohort using a highly accurate rule extraction algorithm, the predictive accuracy was 79.2%. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity were 88.9%, 35.7%, 86.2% and 41.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION We successfully generated a useful model for predicting NASH in Japanese morbidly obese patients based on their biochemical profile using a rule extraction algorithm.", "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.4254/wjh.v10.i12.934", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6323515, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

As these AI-exposed establishments adopt AI, they simultaneously reduce hiring in non-AI positions and change the skill requirements of remaining postings.
